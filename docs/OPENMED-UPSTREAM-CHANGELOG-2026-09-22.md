# OpenMed upstream — complete update list + vendored-component inventory — 2026-09-22

Owner: PM-HEALTHADVOCATE (session 3). CEO order 2026-09-22, two parts:
(1) list ALL upstream updates in openmed and any other vendored components;
(2) align the lane's work with all org directives, starting with the
Prose→Code + ML program. Companion to
`docs/OPENMED-UPSTREAM-LEVERAGE-2026-09-17.md` (24-row decision matrix §4,
staged upgrade path §5). Status: inventory + list are the deliverable here;
execution of Stages 0–2 rides separately through normal PR flow.

## 1. Vendored-component inventory — openmed is the ONLY one

| Component | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `openmed/` | **VENDORED** — fork point upstream **v1.4.0** (2026-05-04); landed by single commit `bcf9990` (2026-05-12); 67 tracked files; exactly 3 local patches (init refactor, config thread-lock + tomllib, offset-safe reidentify) | `git log --oneline -- openmed/` = one commit; `diff -rq` vs `git archive v1.4.0 openmed` = 3 files (companion doc §2) |
| `healthadvocate/static/app.js`, `styles.css` | first-party (no bundled JS/CSS libraries, no web fonts, no tracker scripts) | `git ls-files '*.js' '*.css'` returns exactly those two |
| `skills/healthadvocate/` | first-party skill for THIS product (SKILL.md + openai.yaml) | repo-native content |
| `tests/`, `docs/`, `build/receipts/` | first-party | — |
| Python dependencies (`healthadvocate/requirements.txt`) | **pinned, not vendored** — installed from PyPI at build time; runtime-resolution analysis (vendored copy shadows the pin) in companion doc §1 | pin lines + `engine.py` sys.path insert (pre-Stage-0) |
| `_reference/openmed-upstream/` | local-only reference clone, never committed (`.git/info/exclude`) | `git ls-files _reference` = empty |

Conclusion: the update list below is **exhaustive for this repo's vendored
surface** — one component, 16 releases behind, 3,600 commits behind.

## 2. Complete upstream release list — v1.4.0 → v2.5.0 (16 releases; verbatim text in §4)

Headline = dominant theme; HA-impact cites the decision-matrix rows of the
companion doc (ADOPT / ADAPT / SKIP / EVALUATE + stage).

| Version | Date | Headline | HA impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.4.1 | 2026-05-17 | `ModelLoader` local-path resolution, `local_files_only=True` offline loading, `model_id` alias | **ADOPT on-bump** — matches local-first posture (row 2) |
| 1.5.0 | 2026-05-18 | PII language packs (ar/ja/tr/ko/ru/vi/ro + 34-code catalog, checksum-valid ID validators) | ADAPT on-demand (row 3) |
| 1.5.1 | 2026-05-21 | release metadata only (version surfaces, tag-driven publish prep) | none |
| 1.5.2 | 2026-05-27 | **privacy-filter RCE hardening** — `trust_remote_code` default flipped to False + first-party allowlist + override | **SEC, ADOPT on-bump** (row 1) — the security release our pip floor (`>=1.5.2`) named but never actually ran (shadowed) |
| 1.5.5 | 2026-06-08 | batch PII/de-identification (`BatchProcessor` first tranche) | ADAPT Stage 3 (row 10) |
| 1.6.0 | 2026-06-22 | policy-aware de-identification (ten-stage pipeline, 6 bundled policy profiles, signed/reproducible audit reports); unique placeholders `[NAME]`/`[NAME_2]`; shift_dates + round-trip fixes | ADAPT Stage 3 + **BRK: test updates** (rows 4–6) |
| 1.7.0 | 2026-07-01 | clinical-term protection default ON in PII extraction; frozen `AnalyzeResult` Mapping output | deliberate adapt, gated by tests (rows 7–8) |
| 1.8.0 | 2026-07-09 | model warm pools, `/models/unload`, loader-cache release; no-raw-PHI logging, offline-mode socket blocking | ADAPT Stage 3 (rows 10–11) |
| 1.8.1 | 2026-07-10 | attention `auto` no longer forces SDPA onto unsupported architectures (e.g. DebertaV2) | ADOPT on-bump (row 9) |
| 1.9.0 | 2026-07-14 | ONNX cross-runtime inference APIs (`OnnxModel` CPU), Android batch runner, public `openmed` npm package, HF Hub pull helpers | EVALUATE later (row 12) |
| 1.9.1 | 2026-07-14 | static API gates recorded — additions-only from here through 2.5.0 | compatibility evidence (companion §3) |
| 2.0.0 | 2026-07-28 | cross-platform platform release: upstream MCP server (30+ tools, OAuth-style boundaries), telemetry-off-by-default enforcement, `DEVICE` canonical label | **SKIP upstream MCP — keep HA's deliberately-scoped 4-tool server** (row 15); telemetry-off = no-op adopt (row 16) |
| 2.1.0 | 2026-08-12 | dependency-free `.odt` extraction, read-only GraphQL endpoint, versioned HMAC-SHA256 request signing | SKIP — no HA surface consumes these |
| 2.2.0 | 2026-08-21 | MLX preview (DeepGrove Maple), Cohere Compass vision-language, synthetic notebook gallery, terminology workbench | SKIP — optional-dependency surface conflicts with minimal local-first posture (row 14 class) |
| 2.3.0 | 2026-09-04 | strict input validation, rooted public error taxonomy, JSON fail-closed loading, bounded parsers everywhere | **ADOPT on-bump** (row 17); NLTK CVE-2026-81726 sits in optional extras HA does not install — keep out of the closure (row 20) |
| 2.5.0 | 2026-09-14 | clinical-preserving preview privacy processing, local privacy-budget ledger, HMAC audit-key rotation, minimum-necessary field selector, FHIR/OMOP validation, bounded multimodal intake | EVALUATE Stage 3+ at the real-case governance milestone (rows 13, 18); Material docs-dep CVE N/A to HA (row 19) |

(No v2.4.0 tag exists — upstream's changelog itself notes 2.5.0 compares
against 2.3.0.)

## 3. Org-directive alignment (CEO order part 2)

**Prose→Code + ML program** (`charters-program/PROSE-TO-CODE-PROGRAM-2026-09-16.md`)
— the four-question test applied to this lane's work:

| Lane work | Was | Now / this session | Why it is the right side |
|---|---|---|---|
| "API compatibility verified" (assessment prose, companion doc §3) | LLM-read assertion | **Stage 1 contract tests** — deterministic tripwire; the bump goes red on a contract break, not on a reading | determinism + trust stakes → code |
| "quarterly upstream sync watch" (Stage 4 prose) | calendar prose | **Renovate on the exact pin** — `==2.5.0` after Stage 2; `.renovaterc.json` (`config:recommended`, automerge) is wired and proven in repo history (PRs #1/#2). Cadence caveat: no recent renovate offers — the first post-2.5.0 upstream release is the live test of the watch | code schedules and counts |
| "pip-audit freshness" (desk Q5) | watch prose | already code: CI gate 4 since PR #20 | done prior |
| HA's core engine | — | already the correct side of the ML division: classic-ML transformers NER/PII via openmed (not LLM prose); the LLM-decision surface is fail-closed and disabled by default (`HEALTHADVOCATE_MODEL_ENABLED=0` posture) | LLMs decide/communicate; code verifies — holds |
| This upstream list | would be chat prose | this tracked doc (lands via the Stage-0 PR) + the contract tests that pin the surface it describes | DOC-TAP: docs carry content, chat carries taps |

Standing directives hold by ID, not restatement: DIR-0001 (babysit-free),
DIR-0002 (clocks), DIR-0003 (instrument-or-work-order), DIR-0004 (postmortems),
DIR-0005 (escalation chain), DIR-0006 (naming); zero-spend law; health-data
class law (nothing leaves the workspace; synthetic-only; fail-closed import).

## [2.5.0] - 2026-09-14

OpenMed 2.5 adds clinical privacy and extraction previews, local privacy
and audit controls, FHIR and OMOP validation, bounded multimodal intake,
and registry and training orchestration. This release compares against v2.3.0;
there is no intervening v2.4.0 tag. See the
[release notes](docs/release/v2.5.0.md) and
[migration guide](docs/migration/2.3-to-2.5.md).

### Added

- Added a functional-status zero-shot NER domain with ADL, assistance, mobility,
  functional-scale, assistive-device, and cognitive-status labels, synthetic
  span fixtures, and offline per-label coverage reporting (#911).
- Added complete detection of bounded German postal-address fields and fragment
  protection inside known clinical phrases, with person-name counterexamples
  and independent mask/remove/replace regression checks.
- Added preview clinical-preserving privacy processing with explicit language,
  category and role controls, full-document ONNX tensor batching, bounded
  cancellation and per-document review status. Clinical protection, source
  offsets and output policy remain consistent across the safety sweep.
- Added German clinical context, temporal and quantity extraction regressions,
  memory-streamed Tesseract OCR and PDF reading-order/redaction checks. These
  preview capabilities require independent task and language qualification.
- Added bounded BMP CORE/INFO header geometry preflight with explicit limits,
  value-free errors, and synthetic file-level regression tests (#3114).
- Added bounded GIF logical-screen and bounded global-color-table preflight with explicit limits,
  value-free errors, and synthetic file-level regression tests (#3115).
- Added tiny RF64 refusal fixtures that pin WAV envelope rejection, short-read
  boundaries, and stream restoration without changing the parser (#3117).
- Added bounded VP8, VP8L, and VP8X WebP geometry preflight with explicit limits,
  value-free errors, and synthetic file-level regression tests (#3116).
- Added structural locale normalization and explicit alias duplicate/unsupported-format checks
  with synthetic file-level regression fixtures (#3119).

- Added a privacy-safe multimodal preflight report (`preflight_asset`) that
  runs manifest validation, bounded media-type detection, modality profile
  checks, limit-profile evaluation, and a bounded digest pass in a fixed order
  and returns one accept-or-abstain `PreflightReport` with ordered, allowlisted
  findings, a preflight `AbstentionRecord`, and byte-stable JSON; unevaluable
  checks, including a PDF's pixel rules, abstain rather than accept (#2980).
- Added immutable pre-decode limit profiles for multimodal assets (`MOBILE_V1`,
  `DESKTOP_V1`) with inclusive ceilings for bytes, pages, pixels per unit, total
  pixels, frames, and audio duration, evaluated over the privacy-safe asset
  manifest into deterministic `LimitFinding` records; unevaluable rules,
  including a PDF's pixel rules, are reported as `insufficient_metadata` rather
  than assumed safe (#2956).
- Added an exact schema version and strict, bounded dictionary and JSON parsers
  for privacy-safe agent run summaries, including duplicate-field, non-finite
  number, unknown-field, and unsupported-version rejection (#3038).
- Added strict, content-free multimodal provider result envelopes with bounded
  counts and timing, deterministic serialization, and value-free failures (#3006).
- Added an optional Snowpark adapter and generated Python UDF SQL for
  in-warehouse text de-identification with lazy dependency loading, compatible
  Snowpark registration, and escaped SQL literals (#2369).
- Added an immutable, provenance-aware local terminology cache keyed by exact
  vocabulary releases, with deterministic response fingerprints, stale-release
  refusal, response-free reports, and bounded value-free validation (#2400).
- Added a bounded, deterministic, offline policy-migration checker with
  fail-closed schema and protection-type changes, privacy-safe reports, and a
  report-bound human acknowledgement gate for weakening changes (#2407).
- Added an in-memory no-PHI telemetry exporter with closed counter families,
  bounded dimensions and totals, atomic event validation, exception-type-only
  categorization, deterministic JSON and Prometheus rendering, and no
  mandatory network transport (#2414).
- Added a bounded, deterministic tabular re-identification risk report with
  aggregate-only JSON and Markdown renderers, immutable report state,
  fail-closed consistency checks, and locally derived threshold outcomes
  (#2411).
- Added a deterministic local pre-push privacy scanner that checks every new
  commit blob for direct identifiers, secrets, and sensitive structured fields;
  emits value-free reports; supports narrowly versioned synthetic-fixture
  allowlists; and installs atomically while preserving existing hooks (#2298).
- Added a versioned, bounded privacy policy-as-data schema for jurisdiction,
  recall floors, de-identification actions, surrogate strategy, and
  privacy-safe audit retention, with deterministic local-only loading,
  strict duplicate and alias handling, and value-free validation failures
  (#2406).
- Added a bounded, thread-safe privacy budget ledger for named aggregate
  release contexts with atomic epsilon/delta charging, counts-only evidence,
  immutable configuration views, and value-free failures (#2410).
- Added caller-owned HMAC-SHA256 audit-report key rotation with bounded key
  material, key-ID based current and retained-key verification, canonical
  mapping checks, fail-closed provider handling, and value-free failures
  (#2408).
- Added a bounded, deterministic minimum-necessary structured field selector
  with caller-declared purpose mappings, policy allowlists and denylists,
  fail-closed unknown declarations, value-free decision explanations, and
  projection restricted to selector-approved fields (#2412).
- Added a bounded, counts-only audit-artifact retention planner with explicit
  disposition rules, deletion evidence, remaining-set verification, strict
  input fields, and fail-closed future timestamps (#2409).
- Added a deterministic, offline CycloneDX 1.6 evidence generator for the base
  runtime dependency closure, with source and manifest hashes, bounded local
  inputs, atomic output, and no embedded URLs or build paths (#2416).
- Added a deterministic offline dependency risk report that correlates local
  locked versions with caller-supplied advisory snapshots, emits bounded
  value-free risk summaries, and performs no package-manager or network calls
  (#2417).
- Added deterministic counts-only trace privacy audit artifacts with canonical
  policy and file hashes, immutable category counts, value-free JSON and
  Markdown renderings, stable file fingerprinting, and private atomic writes
  (#2302).
- Added deterministic, PHI-free local release compute, cost, energy, and
  carbon tracking with orchestrator-linked stage timings, per-run and rolling
  budget verdicts, family/tier/workload breakdowns, optional advisory queue
  throttling, and hash-verified ledger replay (#1244).
- Added a bounded, deterministic nested-resource redaction contract with
  explicit scalar paths and actions, stable arrays and identifiers, closed
  policy validation, and raw-value-free reports and failures (#2413).
- Added declarative field-level FHIR and OMOP de-identification policies with
  fail-closed identifier handling, patient-consistent date shifting, schema
  linting, CSV/Parquet support, and resumable FHIR NDJSON integration (#2187).
- Added the canonical grounded-span `to_fhir()` facade with label-driven
  Condition, Observation, MedicationStatement, and Procedure dispatch,
  deterministic Bundle assembly, PHI-free exported/unmapped label counts, and
  graceful skipping for labels without an exporter. The facade remains the
  same callable as the established grounded exporter and never synthesizes a
  Patient resource.
- Added a deterministic, local key-custody metadata validator for synthetic
  signing and surrogate workflows, with lifecycle transition checks,
  purpose/algorithm compatibility, digest-only reports, and fail-closed
  rejection of bytes, secret-like, or unknown fields (#2648).
- Added bounded local deletion verification for fingerprinted sensitive
  artifacts, with symlink, alias, and hard-link refusal, independent recovery
  copies, commit-stage rollback, and counts-only evidence (#2418).

- Added a bounded, manifest-driven deletion impact planner with deterministic
  counts-only reports, reverse-dependency analysis, ownership checks, and
  explicit plan-bound confirmation before injected local execution (#2529).
- Added a deterministic, offline OMOP cohort export validator for key,
  relationship, vocabulary, and NOTE/NOTE_NLP provenance invariants, with
  aggregate counts and content-derived row fingerprints instead of source
  values (#2402).
- Added a bounded, deterministic FHIR R5 Bundle round-trip fidelity diff with
  stable entry matching, explicit serializer-difference declarations, and
  value-free reports containing structural paths, types, and SHA-256 digests
  (#2401).
- Added bounded, deterministic structured access reviews that compare workflow
  read and export declarations with resource schemas and deny policies while
  keeping schema values out of JSON, Markdown, and validation failures (#2419).
- Added bounded, policy-aware diffs for aggregate redaction summaries, with
  closed value-free inputs, deterministic policy fingerprints, and structured
  action, category, and count changes (#2426).
- Added bounded privacy-policy composition with explicit scope-overrides,
  deterministic scope precedence and inheritance, and validated value-free
  decision traces (#2522).
- Added a bounded, metadata-only synthetic privacy regression corpus manifest
  with deterministic fixture hashes, policy and severity coverage validation,
  immutable invariants, and atomic local persistence (#2420).
- Added a bounded, local evidence-bundle integrity verifier with file and
  manifest hashes, policy and provenance checks, and value-free reports
  (#2427).
- Added a bounded tabular schema-drift privacy gate with counts-only evidence,
  conservative stable-ID matching, and release blocking for unsafe role or
  structural drift (#2524).
- Added a bounded, deterministic referential-integrity auditor for surrogate
  maps with cardinality, collision, orphan, and cross-table consistency checks,
  closed input schemas, and counts-only value-free reports (#2538).
- Added a bounded, deterministic nested structured-redaction idempotence checker
  for comparing shape, action, surrogate, policy, and count evidence across
  synthetic FHIR- and OMOP-shaped passes without retaining protected values
  (#2523).
- Added a bounded, offline privacy evidence replay verifier with counts-only
  synthetic manifests, stable policy/environment/result fingerprints, and
  privacy-safe schema, environment, policy, and result drift reports (#2527).
- Added an offline manifest-coherence regenerator and CI drift gate for the
  runtime model registry, PII language defaults, governed README counts,
  registry model cards, and generated model and benchmark documentation (#77).
- Added exact OMOP CDM v5.4 `visit_occurrence`, `observation_period`, and
  `note_nlp` exporters with deterministic local keys, bounded clinical dates,
  source offsets, and assertion-derived NLP term fields (#2360).
- Added exact OMOP CDM v5.4 `measurement` and `procedure_occurrence` row
  exporters with shared Athena concept resolution, deterministic unmapped
  fallback, and preservation of numeric lab values, units, and ranges (#275).
- Added dependency-free US Core 9.0.0 conformance checks for exported
  Condition, laboratory Observation, MedicationRequest, and
  AllergyIntolerance resources, including base-R4-first validation,
  must-support warnings, required-binding errors, canonical profile resolution,
  and compact CC0 constraint metadata (#2366).
- Completed the synthetic grounding/export conformance suite with fail-closed
  out-of-process HL7 FHIR R4 validation, an official-validator malformed
  resource negative control, expanded ACHILLES-style OMOP column/key/reference
  checks, and paired JSON/Markdown `BenchmarkReport` artifacts (#2359).
- Added a versioned federated update metadata envelope with coordinator-owned
  parameter expectations, bounded exact shape arithmetic, deterministic JSON,
  clipping declarations, and value-free rejection of unknown or identifying
  fields (#3010).
- Added typed, canonical governance identifiers for capabilities, purposes,
  policies, workflows, and tools, with shared validation and value-free
  diagnostics (#3042).
- Added a versioned no-PHI exception taxonomy for telemetry and audit records,
  with owner-free approval metadata, bounded digest-only evidence, explicit UTC
  expiry checks, deterministic serialization, and value-free validation
  failures (#2528).
- Added a bounded, deterministic audit-envelope parser with redacted payload
  metadata, canonical fingerprints, strict schema and signature validation,
  and value-free diagnostics (#2594).
- Added a deterministic, local-only privacy exception budget gate that counts
  bounded synthetic waiver metadata by severity, scope, expiry, and policy
  fingerprint, failing closed on exceeded or unbounded exceptions (#2591).

- Added local, deterministic FHIR ValueSet expansion over caller-loaded free
  vocabulary snapshots plus explicit FHIR `$expand` and ECL delegation to a
  caller-supplied terminology endpoint. Results include versioned provenance;
  caching is user-controlled, and restricted member codes are never persisted
  without a second explicit policy opt-in (#926).
- Added closed, versioned federated aggregate metric envelopes with finite
  clipping bounds, minimum-group suppression, coarse participant bands,
  controlled privacy mechanisms, confidence intervals, deterministic JSON,
  and value-free rejection of client-level or unknown fields (#3011).
- Added dependency-free base FHIR R4 structural validation for eight exported
  clinical resource types, including deterministic structured findings,
  cardinality and primitive datatype checks, fixed required bindings, Bundle
  aggregation, and a compact CC0-derived constraint table (#2364).
- Added typed, 128-bit opaque correlation identifiers for agent runs and
  actions, with strict kind-aware parsing, deterministic metadata-only JSON,
  parent-action validation, and value-free failures (#2973).
- Added strict, content-free agent artifact references with opaque identifiers,
  a closed artifact-kind vocabulary, versioned schema IDs, digest and size
  metadata, deterministic JSON, and value-free validation failures, including
  oversized integers and deeply nested JSON (#2999).
- Added a conservative, deterministic FHIR DiagnosticReport exporter with
  R4/R5 union allowlisting (32-field), explicit `unknown` status, type-gated
  scalars and Reference normalization, `effective[x]` mutual exclusivity,
  deep-copy evidence preservation, field-name-only value-free errors, and
  no network or clock dependency (#2566).
- Added privacy-safe multimodal asset batches with opaque batch identifiers,
  canonical asset ordering, duplicate identifier and digest detection, a
  bounded asset count, derived byte, page, frame, and duration totals, and
  sorted value-free findings for invalid, oversized, overflowing, or
  inconsistent batches (#3002).
- Rekeyed the committed model-registry state to schema v2: sparse
  `family::tier::format` release-channel slots (the `baseline_key`
  convention shared by `gates/baseline.json`, `gates/rollout_state.json`,
  and the release ledger), created only by coordinate-matched RELEASABLE
  promotions, with assigned per-slot SemVer that is validated as stored
  state and never recomputed from repo-id version tokens. Ships a
  fail-closed one-time v1 migration (`registry_ctl.py migrate`) that maps
  pointers through committed baseline coordinate evidence and leaves the
  file unchanged on any ambiguity (#1804).

### Security

- Added a local session-end hook that transactionally scrubs completed JSON and
  JSONL traces with value-free failure reports and concurrent-change checks
  (#2300).
- Added deterministic authenticated encryption for reversible surrogate
  mappings, with caller-owned keys, owner-only atomic persistence, and
  value-free failures (#2293).
- Added a fail-closed local dataset-upload privacy guard with block and
  redact-to-staging modes, privacy-safe reports, and private atomic staging
  files (#2297).
- Added a reusable offline CI privacy scanner with explicit scan paths,
  non-transitive synthetic-fixture allowlists, counts-only reports, and atomic
  report writes (#2299).
- Updated the locked Material for MkDocs dependency to 9.7.7, which fixes the
  DOM-based search-suggestion XSS tracked as CVE-2026-73295.

### Fixed

- Preserve the v2.3 family registry API, CLI selectors, serialized views, and
  unambiguous aliases; expose slot operations through `SlotRegistryService`
  with an explicit v2 state contract and fail-closed compatibility adapter.
- Pin Swift tokenization to the validated 0.1.24 release so clean package
  resolution cannot select an incompatible MLX dependency graph.
- Add SDK-only readiness evidence for unchanged model artifacts and pointer
  targets while retaining signed model gates for model releases.
- Validate ONNX label metadata before importing optional runtimes; malformed
  labels now fail at the metadata boundary.
- Keep local privacy-proxy request mappings scoped to one request and reject
  unknown, duplicate, or malformed placeholders on inbound restoration.
- Refresh Debian certificate and OpenSSL package pins used by the container
  build and validate release artifact size budgets against measured growth.

- Fixed verified artifact deletion and rollback on Windows Python 3.12 by
  comparing explicit creation timestamps across pathname and descriptor stat
  results, while retaining identity and in-read mutation checks.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-09-04

OpenMed 2.3 expands the stable v2 contract across privacy-safe agent and trace
workflows, multimodal asset intake, clinical evidence, local training,
cross-platform runtimes, deployment adapters, and release hardening. The final
audited `v2.2.0..v2.3.0` release-branch range contains 252 commits and 651 changed
files.

The static public Python surface grows from 37,735 to 41,729 symbols with
3,994 additions, zero removals or narrowed signatures, and zero new
deprecations. Python, Swift, Kotlin/Android, JavaScript, REST, CLI,
configuration, serialized evidence, and deployment contracts are reviewed in
the [2.2-to-2.3 migration guide](docs/migration/2.2-to-2.3.md).

### Added

- Added a dependency-free, versioned multimodal asset manifest with strict
  media and digest validation, bounded metadata-only fields, deterministic
  JSON serialization, and value-free rejection of paths, URLs, free text, and
  unknown fields (#2954).
- Added bounded streaming SHA-256 asset digests with caller-owned stream
  position restoration and value-free limit and read failures (#2979).
- Added bounded, dependency-free detection for PDF, PNG, JPEG, TIFF, DICOM,
  and WAV prefixes, with stable match, mismatch, and unknown validation results
  that do not log source bytes or trust filename extensions (#2955).
- Added strict, deterministic multimodal abstention records with typed pipeline
  stages, stable reason codes, metadata-only JSON, and value-free validation
  failures (#2977).
- Added image, PDF, DICOM, and audio profiles that validate canonical manifest
  metadata into deterministic field-and-reason findings without opening or
  decoding an asset (#2978).
- Added a closed, JSON-safe agent outcome vocabulary with success, abstention,
  reviewer-handoff, policy-denial, and failure classes, deterministic
  serialization, and value-free rejection of unknown codes or free-text
  reasons (#2950).
- Added bounded, deterministic agent-run summaries for closed outcomes,
  workflow identifiers, tool-call counts, durations, and artifact digests,
  with direct-construction invariants and value-free privacy failures (#2951).
- Added deterministic monotonic timing metadata records for agent runs and
  actions with exact integer durations and value-free validation failures
  (#2974).
- Added deterministic clinical evidence tables with source offsets, controlled
  assertion and review metadata, optional protected-value hashes, and
  value-free JSON and Markdown rendering (#2567).
- Added immutable, non-throwing consent receipt verification results with stable
  content-free outcome codes while preserving one-time receipt consumption.

- Added an audited teacher-ensemble registry for weak labeling with
  manifest-resolved PII and Privacy Filter members, bounded weights and
  agreement thresholds, checksum-validator policies, and fail-closed runtime
  source matching (#284).
- Added an experiencer-aware patient-record span filter
  (`openmed.clinical.filter_patient_record`) that partitions per-span
  `ClinicalAssertion` records into patient-record eligible and excluded sets.
  Non-patient experiencers (`family` and `other`) and hypothetical spans are
  excluded with auditable reasons; negated patient spans are retained and
  marked `refuted`. Includes a medical-device-style advisory disclaimer that
  the filter is a record-construction aid, not a clinical decision (#2251).
- Added a deterministic Jupyter notebook cell redaction helper that preserves
  code sources and execution structure, applies explicit markdown and output
  policies, removes unredacted binary MIME data, and emits counts-only,
  value-free summaries and failures (#2561).
- Added a license-quarantined MedCAT/CogStack subprocess bridge
  (`openmed/interop/bridges/medcat.py`) that shells out to a user-provided
  MedCAT process and maps its `{cui, name, score}` concept output onto
  OpenMed span-code fields (`{system, code, score}`). MedCAT is Elastic
  License 2.0 and is never imported in-process or bundled; invocation is
  blocked until the caller acknowledges the license via
  `OPENMED_ACCEPT_MEDCAT_LICENSE` or an interactive prompt. Added an empty
  `interop-gpl` extra documenting that it installs nothing (#1789).
- Added a deterministic offline resource-path portability audit with bounded
  inputs; traversal, root, reserved-name, normalization, and case-fold checks;
  immutable hash-only reports; and value-free failures (#2637).
- Added a bounded, metadata-only archive extraction safety policy with
  cross-platform traversal and link rejection, normalized duplicate detection,
  expansion limits, and immutable counts-only decisions (#2635).
- Added a deterministic export filename policy derived from validated artifact
  metadata, schema versions, and short provenance fingerprints, with path,
  raw-identifier, clock-derived, and value-leaking input rejection (#2584).
- Added a deterministic offline artifact inventory with bounded safe-path
  handling, byte counts, media types, SHA-256 fingerprints, and aggregate-only
  JSON and Markdown reports (#2581).
- Added a canonical CLI result envelope with bounded counters, artifact

  Markdown, and write errors (#2380).
- Added a standard-library Agent Skills exporter for deterministic ZIP and
  tar.gz bundles with per-file SHA-256 manifests, source revision provenance,
  data-driven host and topical-pack selection, portable source-path checks,
  and rollback-safe overwrite handling (#2307).
- Added a deterministic offline Agent Skills validation gate for frontmatter,
  identifiers, local references, pack membership, and executable-helper help
  and test contracts, with symlink and local-path containment, path-only
  diagnostics, scratch-isolated helper probes, and a dedicated CI workflow
  that runs every focused skill test (#2306).
- Added the local-first `setup-openmed` skill and versioned de-identification
  policy template for collecting five bounded privacy decisions, producing a
  deterministic atomically written review draft with path-free status output,
  and stopping at an explicit human approval gate before the policy can control
  a run (#2305).
- Added an offline-first self-hosted Compose bundle with loopback-only default
  publishing, a hardened non-root runtime, persistent cache and read-only model
  mounts, an internal network, bounded logs and processes, a readiness probe,
  and opt-in-only remote integrations (#2372).
- Added a local-only self-hosted redaction service with explicit text and UTF-8

  aggregate-status page (#2371).
- Added a deterministic synthetic-only de-identification comparator harness
  with explicit fail-closed fixture provenance, enforced offline execution,
  bounded inputs, aggregate privacy metrics, resource budgets, and source-safe
  reports (#2379).
- Added an opt-in bundled-model manifest and offline bootstrap for the small

- Added deterministic offline bootstrap diagnostics for cache readiness,
  integrity manifests, optional dependencies, and local-only configuration,
  with stable exit codes and value-free human and JSON reports (#2376).
- Added a deterministic standalone local-redactor manifest with a synchronized

  payloads, with caller-controlled content paths, deterministic serialization,
  hashed path-only reports, and a local-only default de-identifier (#2281).
- Added local credential and secret-token detection for authorization headers,
  environment values, provider tokens, and private keys, with bounded scanning
  and value-free, hashed diagnostics (#2283).
- Added bounded-memory streaming redaction for structured trace records and
  NDJSON, with independent record and byte limits, deterministic pseudonyms,
  aggregate-only progress, and local cancellation (#2284).
- Added a deterministic, read-only local trace privacy inventory with
  counts-only store, category, and file aggregates; byte ranges; file-status
  totals; hashed caller-supplied labels; and value-free renderers (#2290).
- Added local-only transactional in-place trace redaction with sibling
  temporary files, source-consistency checks, exclusive backups, metadata
  preservation, atomic replacement, cleanup, and value-free errors (#2291).
- Added a deterministic offline trace-fidelity verifier that limits changes to
  declared content fields; preserves order, linkage, identifiers, timestamps,
  labels, scalar types, and structure; and emits hashed value-free diagnostics
  (#2292).
- Added versioned topical agent-skill packs for privacy, interoperability,
  coding, evaluation, and research, with an offline deterministic builder,
  membership and size-budget validation, canonical relative links,
  selection-only output, and fail-closed output preflight (#2303).
- Added the deterministic `ask-openmed` workflow router skill, with a
  fail-closed privacy override for ambiguous or negated safety statements,
  fixed intake-to-verification handoff ordering, canonical links to existing
  skills, and PHI-free route diagnostics (#2304).
- Added standard-library HTML/HTM visible-text extraction with source character
  offsets and markup-preserving redaction write-back (#278).
- Added an offline, versioned key-lifecycle helper and operator guide for
  audit-key rotation, retired-key verification, surrogate-vault re-keying,
  environment isolation, and file-permission hygiene without serializing keys.
- Added conservative two- and three-column PDF reading-order reconstruction,
  preserving source word bboxes and character-span projection while leaving
  single-column extraction byte-for-byte compatible with the source-order path.
- Added deterministic, local redacted-PDF rendering with burned-in opaque
  rectangles, clean non-PHI text-layer reconstruction, global source-text
  removal verification, masked page-layout fidelity reports, synthetic fixtures,
  enforceable regression gates, bounded raster budgets, Type 3 font rejection,
  and plaintext-free serialized evidence with sanitized render errors.
- Added a rooted, backward-compatible public error taxonomy with stable
  machine-readable codes, actionable PHI-safe diagnostics, REST/MCP mappings,
  synthetic contract fixtures, and API documentation.
- Added a production browser token-classification runtime with typed batched
  WebGPU inference, deterministic local WASM fallback, an audited WGSL
  classification head, Python-reference parity and recall gates, per-device
  warm/cold benchmark records, and real headless-browser coverage.
- Added local EML header, plain-text, HTML, and attachment PHI redaction with
  decoded source-offset maps, deterministic safety sweeps, image-only PDF
  attachment output, and an explicit isolated `extract-msg` bridge extra for
  optional Outlook MSG input.
- Added committed Android OpenMedKit release-AAR and offline cold-start budgets,
  with blocking Gradle/CI gates and measured values in the Android job summary.
- Added a Triton ONNX model-repository generator and configuration-selected
  KServe V2 HTTP/gRPC inference backend with local tokenization and decoding,
  mocked local/remote span-parity coverage, and no bundled serving runtime.
- Added a Kopf-based Kubernetes model operator with the namespaced
  `OpenMedModel` CRD, manifest-pointer warm-pool rollouts, lifecycle conditions
  and Events, retained-version rollback, least-privilege RBAC, hardened
  deployment assets, operator documentation, and a synthetic fake-API reconcile
  suite.
- Added a BigQuery-compatible warehouse remote-function handler that validates
  batched row envelopes, groups policy-specific calls through `process_batch`,
  emits PHI-safe error replies, and ships synthetic tests, container deployment
  guidance, and registration DDL (#839).
- Added a deterministic, fully offline `openmed init` project scaffold with
  researcher, app-developer, and data-engineer presets, bundled OpenMedConfig
  schema validation, synthetic starter pipelines, and collision-safe reruns.
- Added opt-in, no-PHI OpenTelemetry spans and aggregate histograms for all ten
  core privacy-pipeline stages, with lazy optional imports, no exporter by
  default, shared `Timer` measurements, synthetic leakage regression tests, and
  an `otel` installation extra.
- Added a minimal local-artifact `edge-sbc` ONNX Runtime profile, native ARM64
  Raspberry Pi and Jetson synthetic benchmark workflow, aggregate cold-start,
  token-throughput, install-size, and peak-RSS records, plus fail-closed
  footprint budgets and archived ARM64 proxy evidence.

### Changed

- Removed the scheduled and manual GitHub-hosted model conversion and Hugging
  Face publication workflows, removed the daily model release-gate cron, and
  removed the hosted Apple Silicon model-conversion smoke job. Model conversion,
  evaluation, and publication remain explicit local maintainer operations
  (#2961).
- Optimized MLX Privacy Filter decoding with bounded BIOES transition-table
  reuse, equivalent NumPy and pure-Python paths, span-local grapheme work,
  binary32-compatible confidence reconstruction, and opt-in kernel compilation
  controls (#2946).

### Fixed

- The `openmed` npm package now defaults to the public
  `OpenMed/OpenMed-PII-ClinicalE5-Small-33M-v1-onnx-android` repository
  (exported as `DEFAULT_MODEL_ID`) and routes `-onnx-android` model ids through
  `loadOnnxModel()` instead of the unavailable former default.
- The `openmed` npm package aligns Transformers.js token-classification output
  back to the source text before BIO decoding through `alignTokenOffsets()`;
  `extractPii()` requests `ignore_labels: []` to retain the full sequence. The
  documented `loadOnnxModel()` to `deidentify()` path no longer silently returns
  zero spans solely because the runtime omits character offsets.
- Token alignment preserves decomposed accents and supplementary Unicode
  letters. Unalignable tokens fail with a content-free error instead of
  silently producing incomplete redaction; custom pipelines can supply exact
  source offsets.

- Preserved the v2.2 numeric-offset TypeScript contracts while adding raw-token
  input types. Model loaders align output and retain runtime metadata and
  resource disposal; the browser extension remains source-compatible.
- Removed obsolete Debian vulnerability exceptions after the current image
  report confirmed they no longer apply; security thresholds are unchanged.

### Known dependency limitation

- Optional agent, LlamaIndex, QuickUMLS, and scrubadub dependency trees include
  NLTK 3.10.3, affected by model-artifact path-security advisory
  [CVE-2026-81726](https://github.com/nltk/nltk/security/advisories/GHSA-8mgp-746c-j5xp).
  No fixed release is published as of 2026-09-04. OpenMed does not call the
  affected APIs, and its service image does not install NLTK. Do not expose
  NLTK model import/export paths to untrusted input in optional integrations.
  The CI waiver is scoped to this CVE, the `nltk` package, and `uv.lock`, and
  expires on 2026-09-11; it cannot suppress a fixed upstream release.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-08-21

OpenMed 2.2 completes the trustworthy clinical-data-exchange milestone across
terminology grounding, document intake, FHIR, OMOP, structured privacy, MCP,
service security, local model runtimes, and offline release evidence. The final
audited `v2.1.0..v2.2.0` range contains 111 commits and 571 changed files.
GitHub generated notes associate 38 PRs with that range, including the
contributor commits preserved by maintainer integration batches.

The static public Python surface grows from 31,619 to 37,735 symbols with
6,116 additions, zero removals or narrowed signatures, and zero new
deprecations. The REST surface grows additively from 17 to 19 paths and from
15 to 17 component schemas through `POST /ground` and
`POST /pii/deidentify/stream`. Swift adds public Maple and Compass local-model
runtimes without removing an existing package API. Android keeps its public
method signatures while making diagnostic descriptions and internal logging
PHI-safe by default.

### Added

- Added pinned DeepGrove Maple Preview support through Python MLX-LM and a
  native OpenMedKit MLX architecture, with privacy-bounded PII removal,
  clinical entities, directed relations, and note-grounded reasoning/chat.
  Added polished iOS scanning, Android Compose, and browser WebGPU demos plus
  reproducible 4-bit/8-bit MLX planning and checksum-verified ONNX/ORT bundle
  tooling. Model weights remain external and every clinical or disclosure
  result requires human review.
- Added first-class Cohere Compass vision-language inference for the five
  OpenMed North Micro Vision MLX precision variants: a native Python runtime,
  a shared OpenMedKit Swift/iOS runtime, local and Hub artifact loading,
  native-resolution image processing, and deterministic text/image parity
  tests across Python and Swift.
- Added a four-part, synthetic-only Jupyter notebook gallery for redaction,
  batch processing, FHIR export, and multilingual evaluation, with offline
  execution and committed-output freshness checks in CI.
- Added a local-first terminology workbench with checksum-pinned vocabulary
  snapshots, exact and ranked grounding, calibration, section context,
  caller-supplied Athena and crosswalk support, value-free provenance, and
  explicit terminology-conflict decisions.
- Added FHIR R4 patient-summary and clinical-document assembly, explicit R4/R5
  conversion boundaries, local profile validation, Bundle reference-integrity
  reports, privacy-safe SDC form handling, OperationOutcome helpers, Bulk Data
  pagination and resumable digest-only checkpoints, and a FHIR-to-OMOP CDM 5.4
  bridge with caller-supplied vocabulary mappings.
- Added deterministic clinical form and key/value extraction, cross-format
  offset projection, PDF table reconstruction, XLSX/PPTX/ODT intake, HL7 v2
  narrative handling, X12 837 redaction, and fail-closed MIME quarantine for
  document intake.
- Added structured privacy profiling and release controls for k-anonymity,
  l-diversity, t-closeness, membership-inference self-tests, aggregate-only
  differential privacy, qualified-review evidence, and local ARX/sdcMicro
  bridge boundaries.
- Added PHI-safe integrations for Arrow Flight, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL
  PL/Python, executable UDFs, distributed SQL, Dataflow, Dagster, Ray,
  pandas-on-Spark, search ingest, and stream processors.
- Added service grounding and streaming de-identification routes, GraphQL,
  backpressure and batching controls, load-test assets, model-cache quotas,
  a CPU INT8 token-classification path, and additive Go/TypeScript client
  coverage.
- Added mTLS, HMAC replay protection, prompt-injection guards, MCP protected
  resource and OAuth-style authorization boundaries, consent receipts,
  upstream endpoint policy, and Part 11-oriented aggregate audit evidence.
- Added local-first Android inference guards with no INTERNET permission,
  socket-denial tests, opt-in typed aggregate logging, hashed entity
  descriptions, and explicit assistive-use documentation.
- Added hard-negative mining, per-language identifier/date traps, clinical
  domain coverage, FHIR round-trip fixtures, timeline provenance, and the
  versioned v2.2 synthetic conformance matrix with pinned FHIR, OMOP, and
  evidence hashes.
- Added optional `fhir`, `dagster`, and `sqlalchemy` extras, expanded the
  multimodal and service extras, and added the `openmed-executable-udf` entry
  point.

### Changed

- Grounding, interoperability, structured privacy, service, and MCP features
  remain offline-first and require caller-supplied licensed terminology,
  credentials, models, or external runtimes where applicable; no restricted
  vocabulary or real-patient fixture is bundled.
- Android `EntityPrediction.description` now emits label, offsets,
  confidence, and a SHA-256 digest instead of raw detected text. Applications
  that need a local UI preview must read the explicit `text` field and must not
  send it to diagnostics or telemetry.
- Active Python, npm, Swift, Android/JitPack, Helm, container, website, and
  documentation coordinates now target `2.2.0` / `v2.2.0`.
- The final candidate wheel is reproducibly 4,134,629 bytes and remains within
  the committed 4,483,996-byte maximum. The gate retains its 4,076,360-byte
  baseline and 10% headroom; the payload contains source, synthetic metadata,
  and the committed model manifest rather than an unexpected binary or
  restricted vocabulary asset.

### Fixed

- Fixed production builds to emit Core Metadata 2.4 for compatibility with the
  PyPI publisher, pinned the recovery workflow for older immutable tags, and
  made npm recovery skip an existing version only after its source commit and
  packaged contents match a fresh tag build.
- Stopped redundant tag-triggered Pages deployments that GitHub's master-only
  environment protection rules reject; documentation continues to deploy from
  `master`.
- Restored the v2.1 public `openmed.clinical.grounding.SnapshotManifest`
  binding while exposing the new vocabulary manifest as
  `VocabularySnapshotManifest`, and retained `ConceptResolver` as a public
  type alias after the OMOP exporter became a package. The v2.1-to-v2.2 static
  API gate now reports zero breaking symbols.
- Reconciled the combined v2.2 batches so FHIR profiles, OMOP mappings,
  grounding provenance, privacy reports, service schemas, generated clients,
  documentation publication, and shared fixtures agree on one integrated
  contract.

### Release integration ledger

- GitHub-generated release-note PRs (38): #2228, #2230, #2237, #2239, #2241,
  #2243, #2244, #2245, #2541, #2543, #2548, #2549, #2550, #2551, #2678,
  #2679, #2680, #2681, #2682, #2685, #2686, #2687, #2688, #2689, #2690,
  #2691, #2692, #2693, #2694, #2695, #2696, #2698, #2699, #2700, #2885,
  #2886, #2887, and #2891.
- The GitHub generated-note set is intentionally smaller than the complete
  111-commit ancestry range because the maintainer batches preserve source
  contributor commits while presenting one reviewed integration PR per
  coherent subsystem.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-08-12

OpenMed 2.1 is the first feature release on the stable v2 line. The audited
source scope covers every current-master change after the `v2.0.0` integration
boundary at `b9ab7a3d`. The current published `v2.0.0` tag resolves to the
rewritten-history commit `94ace7d` and is an ancestor of `master` through that
boundary. Public API compatibility compares the tagged trees directly, while
the integration ledger below follows changes after the integration boundary.

The range adds clinical section, note-type, relation, temporal, coreference,
radiology, discharge, medication, dosing, and fact-faithfulness workflows;
offline terminology grounding, OMOP, FHIR, OpenEHR, cohort, and clinical MCP
surfaces; structured generalization, relational privacy, differential-privacy,
streaming, and attacker-model risk tools; multilingual, RTF, DICOM-SR, OCR,
Android, Flutter, Beam, Ray, Spark, plugin, and model-cache adapters; and
expanded deterministic, signed, rollback-safe evaluation and release gates.

The static Python API grows from 20,538 to 31,619 public symbols with 11,081
additions, zero breaking changes, and zero new deprecations. REST grows
additively from 15 paths and 12 component schemas to 17 paths and 15 schemas.
Android's offset implementation now matches the documented Unicode scalar
contract; callers that treated offsets as Kotlin UTF-16 indices for non-BMP
text should follow `docs/migration/2.0-to-2.1.md`.

### Added

- Added dependency-free OpenDocument Text (`.odt`) extraction with paragraph
  and list reading order, deterministic table linearization, character-offset
  source maps, multimodal registry discovery, and usage documentation (#857).
- Added a read-only Strawberry GraphQL endpoint for selective analysis and
  de-identification fields, canonical entity discovery, policy details, safe
  aggregate risk facets, introspection, and deterministic SDL export (#828).
- Added versioned HMAC-SHA256 request signing over method, path, timestamp,
  nonce, and body digest, with client-side header helpers, bounded fail-closed
  replay protection, and verifier-compatible signatures on async job webhooks
  (#849).
- Added a weekday-themed model release orchestrator that chains conversion,
  synthetic evaluation, signed release gates, model-card generation,
  publication, fresh-environment smoke checks, last-green rollback, quarantine
  reporting, and an append-only offline audit ledger (#1243).
- Completed longitudinal document linking with exact caller-supplied patient
  boundaries, conservative cross-document entity de-duplication with complete
  hashed occurrence provenance, and summary-card/timeline adapters (#1284).
- Added offline family-transfer adapter routing that prefers installed target
  adapters, falls back to compatible donor adapters with scored provenance,
  and returns explicit unsupported or unavailable routing failures (#1331).
- Added stdlib-only RTF text extraction (`openmed.multimodal.extract_rtf`,
  dispatched by `redact_document` for `.rtf`) with a character-offset map back
  to the source. Destination groups such as `\fonttbl`, `\colortbl`, `\info`,
  `\pict`, and `\*`-marked extensions are skipped; control words, control
  symbols, `\'hh` codepage escapes (`\ansicpg`-aware), `\uN` Unicode escapes
  with the group-scoped `\ucN` fallback count, and `\bin` payloads are handled
  without leaking markup into the extracted text (#856).
- Completed clinical temporal timeline composition with DCT/TIMEX anchors on
  every ordered event, transitively reduced public TLINK graphs, metric-ready
  edge keys, and retained/pruned privacy-safe decision provenance (#1253).
- Added closure-aware temporal TLINK F1, PHI-safe transitive-closure
  consistency scoring, a zero-violation blocking gate, and synthetic
  discharge-summary gold with DCT, EVENT-TIMEX, EVENT-EVENT, reduction, and
  contradiction-trap coverage (#1309).
- Added deterministic OncoTree tumor-type mapping
  (`openmed.clinical.load_oncotree`, `map_tumor_type`) against a
  caller-supplied local release snapshot (path / `OPENMED_ONCOTREE_PATH` and
  version / `OPENMED_ONCOTREE_VERSION`; nothing is bundled or downloaded). The
  snapshot must be a flat JSON list of tumor-type nodes; nested OncoTree tree
  dumps are unsupported. Exact and normalized name/code lookup supports an
  optional caller-supplied `synonyms` list and indexes history and revocation
  aliases with current codes winning collisions; unmatched or ambiguous
  mentions stay unmapped with a reason (no fuzzy/lexical fallback).
  Results are version-stamped `OncoTreeMapping` values. Includes synthetic
  golden fixtures and `oncotree_top1_accuracy` evaluation support.
- Added an experimental `yasbd` sentence-segmentation backend selectable via
  `segment_text(..., backend="yasbd")` and
  `analyze_text(..., sentence_backend="yasbd")`, backed by the optional
  `yasbd-lib` extra. The default routing and core dependency set remain
  unchanged; opt-in spans are normalized to OpenMed's exact contiguous-offset
  contract, with explicit errors for missing dependencies, unknown backends,
  and conflicting preconstructed segmenters (#1848).
- Added deterministic Urdu-versus-Arabic disambiguation for shared Arabic
  script runs. `urdu_language_evidence()` scores the six Urdu-exclusive letters
  (tteh, ddal, rreh, noon ghunna, heh doachashmee, yeh barree) and their sixteen
  Arabic presentation forms, derived from single-character NFKC decompositions
  so the Koranic stop-sign ligatures `U+FDF0`/`U+FDF1` are excluded. Extended
  Arabic-Indic digits reinforce an existing letter signal but never trigger one,
  keeping Persian on the Arabic route. Evidence moves `ur` ahead of `ar` in the
  run's candidate order, and runs report `stdlib:urdu-cues` when an Urdu pack is
  registered or `stdlib:arabic-fallback` at a lower confidence when none is.
  Script-run offsets and grapheme boundaries are unchanged (#1571).

- Registered the Indic and Urdu routing candidates (`mr`, `ne`, `bn`, `as`,
  `ta`, `kn`, `ml`, `gu`, `pa`, `or`, `ur`) across the public language
  surfaces. Nepali and Urdu now have display names, model prefixes, and REST,
  MCP, TypeScript, and Go language enums; Nepali resolves to Faker's native
  `ne_NP` locale. Languages in `USER_SUPPLIED_MODEL_LANGUAGES` claim no bundled
  default model and raise an actionable `ValueError` naming every user-supplied
  code when `model_name` is omitted, while `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` stays
  model-backed-only so documented model-backed counts are unchanged (#1569).
- Promoted Vietnamese (`vi`) to a model-backed PII language pack routed to
  `OpenMed/OpenMed-PII-Vietnamese-SuperClinical-Small-44M-v1`, taking
  `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` to 35 codes. Adds Vietnamese month names, deterministic
  locale PHI generation, `vi_VN` surrogate and CCCD provider coverage across the
  REST, MCP, TypeScript, and Go surfaces, and a second synthetic golden i18n
  fixture exercising a native `ngày D tháng M năm YYYY` date, an `0xx` mobile,
  a 12-digit CCCD, and a diacritic-bearing address (#263).

- Added grapheme-aligned mixed-script run routing. `segment_by_script` now
  yields `ScriptRun`, a tuple-compatible `NamedTuple`, and every run boundary
  falls on an extended grapheme-cluster boundary, so a run can no longer split a
  combining sequence, an Indic virama conjunct, a zero-width joiner sequence, or
  a regional-indicator pair. Each cluster takes the script of its first
  script-bearing code point, keeping a cross-script combining mark attached to
  the base character it decorates. `LanguageRun` gained `candidates`,
  `normalizer`, `tokenizer`, and `numeral_set`, and `SCRIPT_NORMALIZERS`,
  `SCRIPT_NUMERAL_SETS`, `normalizer_for_script`, and `numeral_set_for_script`
  expose the per-script routing tables (#1570).

- Added `decide_rollback()` in `openmed/eval/rollout.py`, the pure decision
  function mapping a gate diff to a rollback target. It diffs monitored
  per-label recall and residual leakage against the committed last-green
  baseline via `eval/history.diff_against_baseline`, applies the shared
  `G7_RECALL_DROP_LIMIT` tolerance, and returns `HOLD` / `ADVANCE` /
  `ROLLBACK`. A regression past tolerance rolls back to the committed
  `last_green` pointer and never advances, even when the candidate's own gate
  is `RELEASABLE`. The decision is side-effect-free and reproducible from the
  report plus committed baseline and rollout state with no live API call, and
  emits a PHI-free audit record carrying metric names, numeric deltas, store
  keys and hashes only (#1803).
- Added a read-only catalog coherence gate that checks every `models.jsonl`
  `canonical_labels` value against `openmed.core.labels.CANONICAL_LABELS`,
  resolving aliases (`CHEM`/`SIMPLE_CHEMICAL` -> `CHEMICAL`) while still
  rejecting labels that only survive `normalize_label`'s `OTHER` fallthrough;
  exposed as `openmed.core.labels.is_recognized_label`,
  `openmed.core.catalog_coherence.manifest_label_errors`, and a `Catalog
  coherence` workflow (#2246).

### Changed

- Script runs that previously began inside a grapheme cluster now begin at the
  cluster boundary. A token opening with a combining mark, such as the Gurmukhi
  addak U+0A71, starts one code point earlier because UAX #29 binds that mark to
  the preceding separator. Offsets remain half-open code-point indices and every
  run still tiles the source exactly (#1570).
### Fixed

- Separated fail-closed model promotion from tag-driven Library/SDK
  publication so an SDK tag cannot accidentally attempt a pointer promotion
  without a staged challenger, while retaining API compatibility and migration
  enforcement in the tag-driven provenance job. Recalibrated the synthetic
  Chinese and Indic throughput gate from six GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runs instead
  of comparing hosted Linux against an Apple Silicon workstation baseline.
  Also fixed Transformers 5 local-snapshot loading so `local_files_only` is not
  forwarded twice to `AutoConfig`.

- Refreshed the canonical public model snapshot from 1,520 to 2,266 entries and
  restored the Android AAR's generated on-device catalog with 753 permissively
  licensed ONNX/TFLite entries. Manifest refreshes now disable implicit Hub
  authentication, preserve audited metadata for retained and converted models,
  distinguish generative PII models from token-classification evidence, and
  retain MIT license metadata. Android packaging now fails closed instead of
  writing an empty catalog.

- Replaced the Tamil default's authenticated-only checkpoint with the existing
  public multilingual placeholder and classified Tamil alongside Russian as a
  non-model-backed compatibility route. The stable
  `pii_ta_msuperclinical_large` registry key now resolves to that placeholder;
  production Tamil extraction still requires explicitly qualified weights.

- Fixed quadratic script segmentation on text containing long combining-mark
  runs whose marks carry a different script from their base. Such input passes
  `validate_pii_input` because the combining and format-sequence guards reset on
  each other's characters, and previously cost seconds per document in
  `segment_by_script`, `route_runs`, and `is_indic_text`. Cluster starts are now
  memoized so segmentation stays linear (#1570).

- Fixed `Pipeline.stage2_language_script` rejecting national-ID-only and
  user-supplied language codes that `openmed.core.pii` already accepted, so an
  explicit `lang` is no longer refused one stage earlier (#1569).
- Fixed the shared input gateway rejecting `USER_SUPPLIED_MODEL_LANGUAGES`
  codes. `openmed.utils.gateway.validate_language` now includes them in its
  default acceptance set, so the REST and MCP edges accept every code they
  advertise on their language enums instead of returning `unsupported_language`
  for `ne` and `ur`. `include_national_id` still toggles exactly
  `NATIONAL_ID_ONLY_LANGUAGES` (#1569).
- Fixed day-first date handling for Vietnamese so shifted, replacement, and
  format-preserving date surrogates all render `DD/MM/YYYY` instead of
  `MM/DD/YYYY`, matching the `dmy` locale contract already declared for `vi`
  (#263).
- Corrected the `languages` metadata on the 18 `OpenMed-PII-Vietnamese-*`
  manifest rows from `["en"]` to `["vi"]`, so Vietnamese PII checkpoints resolve
  through `get_pii_models_by_language("vi")`. Those 34 registry keys move from
  `pii_vietnamese_*` to `pii_vi_*` and, as with the Bengali, Chinese, and Tamil
  reclassification, they no longer appear in
  `get_pii_models_by_language("en")`, which drops from 219 to 185 entries
  (#263).
- Fixed the PySpark batch de-identification adapter so
  `make_deidentify_udf()` supplies concrete pandas `Series` annotations during
  UDF construction instead of failing with an unsupported `Any` signature
  (#1942).
- Fixed `openmed risk discover`, `risk assess`, and `risk anonymize` handling
  of UTF-8 BOM-prefixed CSV and TSV schemas so the first column is classified
  consistently, and added bounded validation causes to structured-release CLI
  errors instead of replacing actionable `TypeError` and `ValueError` details
  with a generic schema mismatch.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-28

OpenMed 2.0 expands the local-first privacy, clinical extraction, evaluation,
and deployment stack across Python, Swift, Kotlin/Android, JavaScript, MCP, and
container environments. The release preserves the documented v1 Python entry
points and REST paths while establishing explicit multilingual, structured,
agent-tool, and release-evidence contracts for the v2 line.

### Added
- Added an offline nursing-care observation zero-shot domain with display
  label mappings (IntakeOutput, LineDrainTube, RiskScore, MobilityStatus,
  CareIntervention, PainScore, SkinAssessment), canonical policy label
  metadata, synthetic per-label fixture coverage for risk-score and
  line/drain/tube spans, and domain-coverage evaluation integration (#910).

- Expanded built-in PII routing to 34 language codes and added deterministic
  identifier, date, phone, address, and surrogate support across Chinese,
  Indic, African, Nordic, Central and Eastern European, Russian, Urdu,
  Vietnamese, and regional Arabic workflows.
- Added offset-preserving normalization and segmentation for full-width and
  half-width text, native digits, Simplified and Traditional Chinese,
  Chinese numerals and word boundaries, Indic graphemes and legacy encodings,
  cross-script transliteration, code-mixed Hinglish, and confusable text.
- Added China PIPL, India DPDP and ABDM, South Africa POPIA, Nigeria NDPA,
  Kenya DPA, Egypt PDPL, Morocco Law 09-08, pan-African Malabo, GDPR, EU AI
  Act, ISO 27701/27001, consent-tag, and data-residency evidence workflows.
- Added script-correct multilingual surrogates, Chinese address and Pinyin name
  handling, India identifier and transliterated-name consistency, African
  locale providers, and checksum-valid national-identifier replacements.
- Added deterministic SMS, low-resource CPU, air-gapped installation, model
  integrity verification, crash-safe batch resume, tamper-evident audit,
  Safe Harbor attestation, k-anonymity, adversarial-PHI, and leakage-dashboard
  paths.
- Added an offline structured-data release-risk workflow with advisory
  quasi-identifier discovery, explicit reviewer overrides, patient-level
  k-anonymity, distinct or entropy l-diversity, variational t-closeness,
  bounded hierarchy and suppression search, whole-privacy-unit suppression,
  materialized-output revalidation, and rollback-safe publication.
- Added exact offline reference-population assessment over row-level or keyed
  longitudinal profiles, with k-map, exact-linkage risk, delta-presence,
  conservative unmatched-profile handling, explicit model assumptions, and
  separate data, schema, policy, and integrity digests. Aggregate results do
  not serialize raw profiles or privacy-unit values.
- Added aggregate-only structured-risk dashboards, a strict `openmed risk gate`
  CI command, deterministic expert-review evidence, and expert-authored
  Ed25519 attestations that independently verify signature, evidence binding,
  conclusion, and freshness without claiming automated Expert Determination.
- Added radiology section and finding extraction, serial measurement trends,
  longitudinal document linking, clinical coreference, temporal normalization,
  abbreviation disambiguation, multilingual relations, flowsheets, lab panels,
  discharge summaries, procedures, pulmonology, and pediatrics coverage.
- Added local adapters and packaging for OpenMRS, DHIS2, OpenHIM, community
  health forms, WHO SMART profiles, PySpark, Prefect, scrubadub, LlamaIndex,
  scispaCy, QuickUMLS, and offline ICD-11 grounding.
- Added a typed MCP tool registry with annotations and structured output,
  an `openmed-mcp` entry point, an MCP-enabled container and Compose service,
  and portable repository skills plus agent-oriented documentation feeds.
- Added Chinese and Indic throughput gates, multilingual golden fixtures,
  annotation-agreement and corpus-quality evidence, parser fuzzing, regression
  tracking, model-size and ARM latency budgets, and a fail-closed signed
  release-readiness decision.
- Added watchOS and visionOS OpenMedKit targets, grapheme-safe Swift span
  parity, compact on-device segmenters, Android `EntityPrediction` metadata and
  `OpenMedSpan`, GGUF and WebGPU export guidance, and reproducible Nix
  development environments.
- Added deterministic, fully local longitudinal document linking with
  MinHash-based near-duplicate clustering, directional amendment edges,
  retained superseded documents, and non-text source/target provenance on
  every relationship (#1835).
- Added a PySpark `pandas_udf` adapter (`openmed.interop.spark_udf`) for
  redacting free-text Spark DataFrame columns at warehouse scale via
  `make_deidentify_udf()` and the `deidentify_columns()` convenience helper,
  with the OpenMed model loaded lazily and cached per executor worker
  process. `pyspark` is imported lazily and stays behind the existing `spark`
  extra; the adapter is registered as `spark` in `openmed.interop` (#1816).
- Added a procedures zero-shot domain for surgical and diagnostic procedures,
  devices, and surgical approach, with a new `DEVICE` canonical label,
  keyword routing metadata, and canonical label normalization (#313).
- Added deterministic serial measurement trends that group repeated entities,
  normalize compatible units, order points through the clinical timeline,
  preserve source spans and incomparable readings, and emit a clinician-review
  advisory with synthetic offline direction and grouping gates (#1831).
- Added word-aware Chinese Pinyin romanization with tone-mark, numeric-tone,
  and heteronym output, plus deterministic Han name surrogates and
  tone-insensitive Pinyin vault keys for consistent Chinese name matching.
- Added a fail-closed, signed release-readiness gate that verifies signed model
  gate evidence, release documentation, a machine-readable API compatibility
  report, the public clinical disclaimer, and workflow-produced golden-suite
  evidence before a release can proceed (#1814).
- Added a scrubadub adapter with `to_canonical()`/`from_canonical()` span
  conversion and canonical label mapping for scrubadub's core `Filth` types
  (including the `en_US`/`en_GB` locale detectors), splitting `credential`
  matches into separate `USERNAME`/`PASSWORD` entities using scrubadub's
  named regex groups, flattening scrubadub overlap wrappers without label loss,
  and losslessly recombining credential matches on the return trip. Scoreless
  scrubadub spans default to fallback priority during OpenMed arbitration.
  scrubadub stays an optional `scrubadub` extra, and the adapter is
  registered lazily as `scrubadub` in `openmed.interop` (#281).
- Added a full Russian (`ru`) PII language pack, including Cyrillic date,
  phone, postal-index, and street-address patterns, SNILS (insurance account
  number) and OMS (health-insurance policy number) validators with
  checksum-backed surrogates, and service/SDK wiring. Russian uses the
  documented multilingual default-model placeholder until dedicated weights
  ship; the release-wide supported PII language-code allow-list now covers
  34 codes (#1860).
- Added opt-in token-level language identification for Hinglish clinical text,
  with exact offset-only decisions, deterministic local fallback routing,
  optional caller-supplied model hooks, and synthetic token-accuracy and
  de-identification recall gates (#1490).
- Added an offline, native ARM64 SMS-scale INT8 latency benchmark with a
  committed synthetic corpus, exact model artifact provenance, aggregate
  p50/p95/throughput/peak-RSS reporting, a Raspberry Pi 5 target envelope, and
  a CI gate that fails regressions beyond the permitted 20% tolerance (#1456).
- Added opt-in Simplified/Traditional Chinese normalization through OpenCC,
  including Taiwan and Hong Kong conversion configs, mixed-variant detection,
  and offset-preserving span projection back to original text (#1467).
- Added source-aligned Chinese numeral parsing for everyday and financial
  forms, valid year/month/day normalization, and contextual Chinese date,
  medical-record identifier, and clinical-quantity PII patterns (#1469).
- Added a Swahili README and an African developer onboarding guide covering
  bandwidth-aware model sizing and offline setup, POPIA/NDPA policy pointers,
  OpenMRS FHIR and DHIS2 Tracker recipes, community links, and shared
  translation-drift enforcement (#1455).
- Added an offline-first `openmed models size` command with committed download,
  disk, and peak-RAM estimates, cache-aware remaining bytes, per-task bandwidth
  recommendations, JSON output, and explicitly opt-in remote refinement (#1453).
- Added an opt-in, offline FHIR R4 profile checker for locally supplied WHO
  SMART Guidelines implementation-guide packages, including cardinality,
  fixed-value, locally enumerable binding, identifier/category slice, and
  post-de-identification conformance checks (#1451).
- Added local, structure-preserving de-identification for ODK Central,
  CommCare HQ, and KoBoToolbox JSON/CSV form exports, including XForm path
  semantics, repeat fidelity, safe unknown-text handling, geopoint
  generalization, and value-free policy manifests (#1450).
- Added an opt-in OpenHIM de-identification mediator with authenticated
  registration and heartbeats, FHIR and text transformation envelopes,
  byte-preserving opaque pass-through, and an offline container smoke fixture
  for deployment inside an HIE trust boundary (#1448).
- Added data-driven African healthcare-context safety-sweep terms for named
  facilities, mobile-money references, and context-gated ethnic affiliations,
  with non-keep defaults across the initial African policy profiles and
  synthetic no-leak fixtures (#1447).
- Added PHI-free, hash-verifiable Africa data-residency attestations for audited
  local de-identification runs, with data-driven jurisdiction wording, exact
  policy and model provenance, conservative captured offline evidence, a public
  JSON Schema, and an offline deployment and review guide (#1446).
- Added an Igbo (`ig`) PII pack for Nigerian clinical text with NFC, NFD, and
  unmarked context support, native `ig_NG` surrogates, shared Nigerian NIN and
  phone patterns, and grapheme-safe replacement of dot-below names (#1441).
- Added a Yoruba (`yo`) PII pack with NFC, NFD, and unmarked context support,
  native `yo_NG` surrogates, and grapheme-safe normalized span remapping and
  replacement boundaries for stacked dot-below and tone marks (#1440).
- Added a deterministic Hausa (`ha`) PII pack for Boko and numeric Ajami text,
  including Nigerian NINs, Nigerian and Nigerien phone numbers, exact-offset
  native-digit matching, `ha_NG` surrogates, and Arabic-script arbitration
  without claiming Ajami lexical coverage (#1439).
- Added build-generated `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` documentation feeds with
  curated quickstart, API, de-identification, agent, MCP, and REST coverage,
  plus strict local and Pages build checks (#1787).
- Added character-offset Chinese and Hindi clinical relation extraction over
  existing multilingual NER spans, including the versioned 44-predicate CMeIE
  mapping, constrained graph decoding, assertion propagation, synthetic gold,
  and distinct per-language relation F1 reporting (#1205).
- Added a Prefect integration with a `deidentify_file_task` task and a
  `deidentify_dataset_flow` flow that fan the local dataset redaction runner
  over lists of files and return PHI-free count summaries. Prefect stays an
  optional `prefect` extra, and the adapter is registered lazily as
  `prefect` in `openmed.interop` (#471).
- Added a deterministic radiology report parser that separates findings,
  impression, and recommendation text with provenance spans, captures only
  explicitly stated BI-RADS or Lung-RADS categories, and includes synthetic
  offline accuracy gates (#1838).
- Added a deterministic radiology-finding extractor that binds laterality,
  measured size, and anatomic location with per-field provenance, supports
  caller-supplied offline RadLex JSON mappings, and includes a synthetic
  finding-tuple-F1 gate (#1837).
- Added a deterministic, offline ISO 15919 transliteration pivot for nine Indic
  scripts, ITRANS and Harvard-Kyoto parsing, offset-preserving romanization,
  and cross-script person-name linkage in surrogate vaults (#1483).
- Added an offline Vietnamese (`vi`) PII language pack with context-gated CCCD
  and legacy CMND detection, Vietnamese dates, phone numbers, addresses and
  five-digit postal codes, plus `vi_VN` surrogates and a synthetic golden
  fixture (#819).
- Added region-qualified Arabic Faker locales (`ar-SA`, `ar-AE`, `ar-JO`,
  `ar-PS`, and explicit `ar-EG`) so Gulf and Levant text receives in-region
  surrogates; bare `ar` still defaults to `ar_EG`. Locales missing from the
  installed Faker fall back to `ar_EG` with a one-time warning, and
  `list_regional_locales('ar')` enumerates the supported tags (#483).
- Added curated conceptual surrogate locales for Senegal, Côte d’Ivoire,
  Cameroon, Mozambique, and Angola (`fr_SN`, `fr_CI`, `fr_CM`, `pt_MZ`, and
  `pt_AO`), including in-country names, addresses, cities, phone formats, and
  context-only Senegal CNI and Angola BI detection. Arabic regional overrides
  now also document `ar-DZ` and `ar-MA`; unavailable Faker backends retain the
  existing one-time-warning fallback to `ar_EG` (#1443).
- Added conservative Egypt PDPL and Morocco Law 09-08 policy profiles with
  complete mask action maps, no reversible mappings, mandatory safety sweeps,
  declarative `ar_EG`/`ar_MA` clinical identifier formats, and a decision-support
  compliance checklist covering sensitive-data and transfer controls (#1444).
- Added a release evidence job that keylessly signs each wheel and source
  distribution with Sigstore and attaches the SLSA provenance bundle, the
  release artifact digest manifest, and the Sigstore bundles to the tagged
  GitHub release, so a release can be verified offline without the GitHub
  attestation API. Evidence generation stays best effort and cannot gate the
  PyPI upload, but evidence that is produced must verify against the signing
  workflow identity and the release commit before it is attached (#1540).
- Added a Hungarian (`hu`) national-ID-only PII pack with validator-backed TAJ
  detection, `hu_HU` locale-aware synthetic surrogates, Hungarian date, phone,
  address, and postcode patterns, and an offline synthetic golden fixture
  (#816).
- Added a Czech (`cs`) national-ID-only PII pack with validator-backed rodné
  číslo detection, Czech date, phone, address, and postcode cues, `cs_CZ`
  locale-aware synthetic surrogates, and an offline synthetic golden fixture
  ([#815](https://github.com/maziyarpanahi/openmed/issues/815)).
- Added a release run-ledger builder that records, per family, which candidate
  artifact was published under which gate decision, binding the artifact digest
  to a recomputed `GateReport` hash so a published artifact provably passed the
  gate it claims. Non-`RELEASABLE` families are quarantined with no publish
  target, the run outcome is reconstructable offline from
  `gates/release_runs.jsonl`, and the ledger carries only identifiers and
  hashes. Adds `compute_canonical_payload_hash()` to `openmed.core.repro_hash`
  as the generic counterpart to the training-shaped
  `compute_reproducibility_hash()` (#1805).

### Changed

- Made the language-pack catalog the shared source of truth for runtime,
  service, registry, fixture, documentation, and CLI capability reporting.
- Added uniform CLI JSON output and error envelopes and strengthened
  model-download, manifest-signature, provenance, SBOM, secret-scan, and
  dependency-policy enforcement.
- Added the `DEVICE` canonical clinical label. Consumers that treat canonical
  labels as a closed enum must add the new value before adopting v2.
- Added optional extras for Chinese, Indic, language identification, integrity
  verification, OpenMRS, scrubadub, Prefect, scispaCy, and QuickUMLS; raised
  the optional MCP runtime floor to the v1.27 API line.

### Compatibility

- Preserved all public Python symbols from `v1.9.1`; the static API comparison
  records 6,050 additions, no removals or narrowed signatures, and no newly
  deprecated symbols.
- Preserved the existing REST/OpenAPI path and schema set. Swift, Android, npm,
  service, configuration, and serialized evidence changes are additive except
  for closed-enum consumers that must recognize `DEVICE`.
- Preserved the documented root imports, including `OpenMedConfig`,
  `analyze_text`, `deidentify`, and `extract_pii`.

### Fixed

- Corrected compact Indic segmenter licensing to the valid SPDX `ICU`
  identifier, pinned the immutable ICU 57.1 source revision, retained the full
  source copyright and permission notice in Python distributions and standalone
  model bundles, and added fail-closed Python, Swift, and release-policy
  validation.
- Corrected PharmaDetect medication boundaries and optional precision
  filtering, contrastive-clause experiencer scope, radiology span and
  laterality binding, cross-platform path handling, and model-loader behavior
  across stale caches and low-memory environments.
- Allowed explicitly selected models to run with deterministic pattern-only
  language packs while keeping the no-default-model path fail closed.
- Restored direct Hub-ID loading for pre-manifest MLX artifacts that carry
  trusted converter markers, kept local PyTorch privacy-filter snapshots on
  Torch, and continued to reject unmarked bundles.
- Root-anchored Hatch build patterns so wheel and source distributions cannot
  absorb nested local worktrees or workspace-control files.
- Raised the optional spaCy integration to 3.8.9+, isolated its NumPy 1.x ABI
  route from incompatible ONNX combinations, and resolved factory type
  annotations before spaCy's Pydantic-backed config validation.
- Stabilized the long-input and arbitrary-text de-identification fuzz
  properties across slower CI platforms by keeping their deterministic example
  budgets and safety assertions while leaving performance enforcement to the
  dedicated latency and throughput gates.

### Security

- Added telemetry-off-by-default enforcement, mixed-script and confusable PII
  defenses, no-raw-PHI evidence formats, integrity-checked model downloads,
  tamper-evident audit chains, consent and data-use enforcement, and
  reproducible release evidence.
- Updated vulnerable locked dependencies and kept release images, Python and
  npm artifacts, Android coordinates, and signed evidence on independent,
  fail-closed validation paths.
- Required ONNX 1.21+ for ONNX-producing optional routes, refreshed the
  universal dependency lock to the fixed ONNX line, and excluded generated
  SBOM, audit, vulnerability, and JavaScript dependency artifacts from Docker
  build contexts so local evidence and development dependencies cannot
  contaminate service images or image scans.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-07-14

This patch completes the `1.9` distribution rollout without changing the
public inference APIs introduced in `1.9.0`.

### Fixed

- Restored the documented root Swift Package Manager build by processing
  OpenMedKit policy resources in the root package, and moved Swift CI to build
  and test that public package entry point.
- Kept tag-driven Android validation green when the optional Maven Central
  signing credentials are absent while retaining the immutable JitPack release
  path and guarded manual Central uploads.
- Replaced placeholder model repository IDs in runtime and export documentation
  with tested public token-classification and causal-model examples.

### Security

- Updated the locked `setuptools` build dependency to a non-vulnerable release
  so the master and release `pip-audit` gates pass without a waiver.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-07-14

This release adds one model-repository contract for ONNX token-classification
inference across Python, browsers, Node.js, and Android, then extends the
clinical, multilingual privacy, evaluation, documentation, and developer
surfaces delivered after `v1.8.1`.

### Added

- Added concise cross-platform ONNX inference APIs: `OnnxModel` for Python CPU,
  `loadOnnxModel` for WebGPU/WebAssembly, and `OpenMedKit.fromDirectory` for
  Android with Hugging Face tokenizer offset parity. The same exported model
  repository can now serve every supported runtime without application-level
  tokenizer or tensor plumbing (#1550).
- Added a resumable Android ONNX batch rollout runner, Android/ORT model-card
  format metadata, immutable Git-tag installation through JitPack, and runnable
  MLX examples for token classification and GLiNER zero-shot NER (#1550).
- Added the public `openmed` npm package for browser and Node.js inference, with
  synchronized release versions, ESM/CommonJS exports, WebGPU/WebAssembly
  examples, package tests, npm audit enforcement, and provenance-backed tag
  publishing (#1550).
- Added Hugging Face Hub model-pull convenience helpers and artifact-backed
  model-card datasheets generated from provenance-hashed evaluation evidence
  (#1339, #1228).
- Added an offline immunization zero-shot domain with FHIR-aligned display
  labels, canonical policy metadata, synthetic per-label fixtures, and
  exporter-alignment documentation (#1159).
- Added an offline pediatrics-growth zero-shot domain with growth-parameter,
  percentile, z-score, developmental-milestone, feeding-history, and finding
  display labels, canonical policy metadata, and synthetic per-label fixture
  coverage (#1611).
- Added relation metrics, a synthetic gold loader, strict and relaxed clinical
  relation-extraction scoring, an RE release gate, and a dataframe API for
  clinical extraction results (#1211, #1212, #1224).
- Added a Go REST client, a Postman collection, copy-paste REST recipes, and a
  Jupyter/IPython rich display widget for de-identification results (#1379,
  #1385, #1387, #1382).
- Added full Korean (`ko`) and Romanian (`ro`) PII language packs, including
  native identifier validation, locale-aware surrogates, synthetic fixtures,
  and model/service wiring. The model-backed PII allow-list now covers 17
  language codes (#1544, #1389).
- Added Canadian SIN and provincial health-card validators, Australian Medicare
  and TFN validators, CJK family-name-first honorific stripping, RTL-aware
  redacted-output rendering, multilingual clinical section detection,
  translation augmentation for low-resource NER, and multilingual surrogate
  quality gates (#1340, #1342, #1346, #1384, #1226, #1221, #1225).
- Added critical-finding recall and leakage-under-extraction safety gates, a
  multilingual clinical NER benchmark aggregator, a false-negative explorer,
  throughput-versus-accuracy frontier reporting, inference memory profiling,
  property-based de-identification fuzzing, a burned-in-PHI DICOM benchmark,
  and a redactor threat model with leakage-bypass abuse cases (#1213, #1214,
  #1223, #1343, #1347, #1349, #1350, #1388, #1352).
- Added a public-API docstring coverage check plus PEP 561 `py.typed` packaging
  and scoped type-hint coverage for the expanded module surface (#1341, #1348).
- Added persona quickstarts, hardened offline model loading, and a dedicated
  troubleshooting and common-errors guide (#1386, #1380).

### Changed

- Consolidated OpenMed's brand and on-device clinical-AI messaging across the
  repository, documentation, and website (#1415).
- Bounded the ten-stage clinical pipeline on long notes and strengthened offline
  loading paths used by the new runtime quickstarts (#1383, #1386).

### Fixed

- Hardened Android ONNX export and publishing for large external-data graphs,
  Longformer tracing, fp16 metadata, dynamic INT8 graph ordering, optional ORT
  conversion failures, existing Hub repositories, and models that require
  zero-valued `token_type_ids` at runtime (#1550).
- Made Android artifact reuse fail closed when runtime files or ONNX external
  data are missing, required `tokenizer.json` before publication, and kept
  resumable batch cleanup from deleting valid artifacts (#1550).
- Made direct `OpenMed/...-mlx` repository IDs resolve as pre-converted MLX
  artifacts and kept optional tokenizer loading lazy, avoiding unintended
  PyTorch conversion and eager pandas imports (#1550).
- Aligned Python, npm, Swift, Android, Helm, OpenAPI, container, and demo release
  surfaces on `1.9.0` and immutable release coordinates (#1550).

### Security

- Replaced fixable vulnerability waivers with dependency and base-image
  upgrades, and made the vulnerability gate reject waivers when a fixed version
  is available (#1550).
- Added explicit release gates for critical-finding recall and leakage under
  clinical extraction, alongside the redactor threat model, de-identification
  fuzz harness, and synthetic burned-in-PHI DICOM benchmark (#1213, #1214,
  #1350, #1352, #1388).
## [1.8.1] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- Fixed automatic PyTorch attention selection so `auto` no longer forces SDPA onto Transformers architectures that do not support it, including `DebertaV2ForTokenClassification`; explicit `eager`, `sdpa`, and `flash_attention_2` selections remain available.
- Changed unavailable accelerated-attention fallbacks to use the architecture-independent eager implementation instead of selecting another accelerated backend from runtime capability alone.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-07-09

This release summarizes the cross-platform runtime, service hardening, multimodal privacy, clinical extraction, and release-evidence work merged after `v1.7.0`. The reviewed range is broad: 434 commits from `v1.7.0` through the final `release/openmed-180` branch tip prepared for the `v1.8.0` tag, covering Android, browser, and React Native runtimes, production service controls, structured health-data pipelines, and the privacy/evaluation gates that keep those surfaces aligned.

### Added

- Added the Android OpenMedKit surface: a Gradle project, Kotlin public API, token-classification decoder, ONNX and ORT Mobile paths, ML Kit OCR adapter, model catalog/download cache, document/image intake, Compose demo, scan demo, Python-to-Android span parity fixtures, Android CI, and guarded Maven Central publishing (#1114, #1115, #1116, #1117, #1118, #1119, #1120, #1121, #1122, #1123, #1124, #1146, #1148, #1149, #1150, #1155, #1156, #1161, #1162).
- Added browser, mobile JavaScript, and cross-platform client runtimes, including a typed OpenMedKit web package for Transformers.js/ONNX Runtime Web, a React Native bridge, Swift-Kotlin parity checks, public API parity coverage, and a typed TypeScript service client surface (#1132, #1177, #1178, #1123).
- Added production service and deployment capabilities: API-key/JWT auth, request correlation IDs, no-PHI JSON logging, OpenTelemetry tracing, gRPC, async jobs and webhooks, Helm deployment, multi-arch containers, circuit breakers, model-load retry/backoff, privacy-gateway redaction before external calls, SMART-on-FHIR bulk ingestion, object-storage batch runs, Spark/Dask/lakehouse/columnar redaction, DuckDB and pandas/polars accessors, agent/MCP tool orchestration, hardened distroless images, image signing, SLSA provenance, container SBOMs, and vulnerability scanning (#1080, #1081, #1082, #1084, #1109, #1110, #1126, #1127, #1129, #1130, #1131, #1133, #1136, #1138, #1139, #1140, #1141, #1143, #1144, #1152, #1153, #1154, #1175, #1176, #1179, #1180, #1185, #1189).
- Added deeper clinical extraction and interoperability: normalized clinical timelines, document assertion graphs, clinical event frames, medication relation decoding, concept normalization, UCUM units, free vocabulary grounding, RxNorm/ICD-10-CM/HPO linkers, CodeableConcept export, deterministic CDM extraction, OMOP CDM loader foundation, GDPR DSAR export, and severity/laterality, clinical-genomics, gastroenterology, endocrinology, nutrition/diet, and anesthesia domain coverage (#1019, #1022, #1025, #1026, #1027, #1079, #1086, #1105, #1134, #1135, #1137, #1160, #1164, #1165, #1166, #1167, #1170, #1182, #1183, #1184, #1187, #1219, #1292, #1299).
- Added multimodal and structured privacy coverage for DOCX offset extraction, plain-image redaction, DICOM header de-identification, burned-in DICOM pixel OCR redaction, redacted-PDF text-layer fidelity checks, EPUB extraction, vCard/iCalendar PHI redaction, UK health identifiers, IBAN/SWIFT/BIC identifiers, passport/MRZ validation, and additional validator-backed ID packs for Slovak, Latvian, Malay, Filipino, and Danish locales (#1093, #1098, #1106, #1107, #1108, #1112, #1128, #1142, #1163, #1171, #1173, #1186, #1188, #1406).
- Added evaluation, model, and release evidence infrastructure: streaming token classification, speculative MLX PII decoding, QLoRA smoke recipes, leakage-weighted distillation, Core ML and ONNX optimization/parity gates, OpenVINO export, paged KV-cache attention, memory-budgeted model scheduling, benchmark ledgers, active-learning gate queues, hard-negative mining, cross-lingual transfer evaluation, model-card/datasheet generation, flakiness quarantine, conformal calibration and abstention, mobile performance benchmarking, comparator matrices, load-test harnesses, and training provenance reproducibility gates (#1002, #1003, #1009, #1014, #1015, #1016, #1017, #1018, #1036, #1054, #1055, #1056, #1062, #1063, #1064, #1065, #1066, #1097, #1113, #1147, #1151, #1172, #1220).
- Added an endocrinology zero-shot domain for glycemic and thyroid-function
  measures, hormone levels, insulin regimens, metabolic findings, and endocrine
  glands, with canonical label normalization, keyword routing metadata, and
  synthetic fixture coverage (#895).
- Added `examples/gradio_deid_app.py`, an interactive Gradio demo that runs
  `deidentify` over synthetic text with a `mask`/`replace`/`hash` method
  selector and shows the redacted output alongside the detected PII entities.
  `gradio` stays an optional, example-local dependency with a graceful install
  hint, and the example is covered by import-safe smoke tests (#484).
- Added an `OPENMED_MLX_MMAP` toggle to `openmed.mlx.models.load_model`:
  safetensors weights load through MLX's memory-mapped, lazy path by default
  (keeping cold-start peak RSS low on the phone/laptop tiers), with
  `OPENMED_MLX_MMAP=0` forcing eager materialization as a documented fallback
  for debugging (#296).

### Changed

- Extended OpenMed from a Python/Swift-centered toolkit into a coordinated Python, Swift, Kotlin/Android, TypeScript, React Native, browser, REST, gRPC, and deployment release, with parity tests and shared fixtures keeping the platform surfaces aligned.
- Updated release engineering around guarded PyPI publishing, SLSA attestations, SBOMs, signed images, static OpenAPI regeneration, reproducible release metadata, baseline-aware secret scanning, and guarded mobile/container publishing so library, container, and mobile artifacts can be validated from the same source tree (#1104, #1144, #1153, #1154, #1405).

### Fixed

- Fixed optimizer-stripped assertions, explicit UTF-8 handling, JSON decoding failures, exception chaining, iOS MLX pinning, multilingual test span offsets, Pages deployment concurrency, HPO linker test adaptation, DSAR vault-key matching, and lint cleanup after the large v1.8 merge train (#1091, #1094, #1095, #1096, #1100, #1158, #1181, #1194, #1404).

### Security

- Added and strengthened no-raw-PHI logging, offline mode socket blocking, privacy-gateway redaction before external LLM calls, policy compiler coverage proofs, DP surrogate budgeting, k-anonymity/l-diversity/t-closeness enforcement, membership-inference defenses, adversarial de-identification robustness, federated leakage evaluation, secret scanning, pre-commit hook scanning, and vulnerability gates (#189, #190, #1034, #1035, #1037, #1043, #1047, #1082, #1127, #1141, #1405).

## [1.7.0] - 2026-07-01

- Added clinical extraction and normalization helpers for labs, vital signs,
  medication sigs, problem lists, summary cards, microbiology labels,
  dermatology and ophthalmology domains, clinical concept labels, and clinical
  term protection, plus deterministic substance, employment, and living-status
  normalization (#552, #410, #560, #718, #683, #773, #684, #691, #698, #767).

  quantization recipes, bitsandbytes 4-bit loading, FlashAttention/SDPA/eager
  attention selection, PyTorch MPS tuning, ONNX/WebGPU and Transformers.js
  exports, tokenizer caching, Mode-A distillation, DAPT corpus assembly, and
  ONNX/quantized artifact publishing metadata (#644, #620, #619, #627, #759,
  #760, #761, #719, #736, #790, #751, #622, #612).
- Added interop adapters for PHILTER, pyDeid, GLiNER-BioMed, LangChain, and the

  release status contracts (#628, #694, #647, #716, #720, #1021, #409, #697).

### Changed

- `analyze_text(..., output_format="dict")` now returns a frozen
  `AnalyzeResult`; `to_dict()` and mapping access preserve the legacy dict shape
  (#611).
- PII extraction and the staged pipeline now apply clinical term protection by
  default, suppressing ambiguous PERSON/LOCATION/ORG matches that exactly match
  protected clinical vocabulary (#698).
- ConText temporality, uncertainty, and negation now use sentence/clause-bounded
  cue scope with section-aware priors and context offsets (#738, #739, #782).
- Pipeline span output can include populated `section` metadata after section
  stamping (#785).
- Lab reference-range parsing now accepts broader separators/operators and treats
  unknown explicit flags as `unknown` rather than deriving a normal/high/low
  result (#560).
- REST `/health` remains as a compatibility alias, while `/livez` and `/readyz`
  expose split liveness/readiness state and shutdown drains in-flight
  model-backed requests (#722).
- REST CORS and trusted-host handling is now deny-by-default except for exact
  configured origins and trusted hosts (#686).
- OCR auto-selection can now pick installed EasyOCR or docTR adapters in
  addition to Tesseract/PaddleOCR (#749, #558).
- Evaluation defaults now include DrugProt and biomedical NER suites, and
  leakage heatmaps now emit label-by-language matrices with totals and worst
  cells (#617, #743, #680).
- Model manifest rows now merge format lists for existing repositories and
  recognize ONNX/WebGPU and Transformers.js export formats (#736, #790).
- CI lint/test/security/build setup moved to `uv sync` / `uv run`, with GitHub
  Actions refs validated and Dependabot Actions updates limited to minor/patch
  bumps (#185, #700).
- PyTorch/HF backends can auto-select MPS on Apple Silicon when no device is set
  (#719).
- AWQ and GPTQ export paths now share synthetic quantization calibration
  metadata (#759).
- `shift_dates` documentation now describes patient-keyed stable date shifting;
  the legacy boolean remains accepted but deprecated in favor of
  `method="shift_dates"` (#704).

### Fixed

- Fixed nondeterministic audit span ordering so report serialization, hashes, and
  signatures are stable while preserving legacy verification (#645).
- Fixed date-shift parity between `python-dateutil` and fallback paths,
  including month-first English month-name dates, and aligned `uv.lock` with the
  dev extra dependency set (#616, #649).
- Fixed deterministic FHIR URN preservation during Bundle assembly (#553).
- Fixed JSON loading paths in core, eval, NER, and risk modules so corrupt JSON
  raises clearer errors or fails closed (#958).
- Fixed optional-extra diagnostics for missing `ftfy`, section detection, and
  date-shift capabilities (#781).
- Reduced numeric false positives in safety-sweep postcode-style matches by
  requiring stronger context (#783).
- Added explicit UTF-8 encodings for subprocess/file I/O paths and preserved
  exception chaining in model load failures (#1088).
- Added timeouts to `subprocess.run` calls in reproducibility hash and
  release-gate issue helpers (#1090).
- Replaced eager f-string logging with lazy logging interpolation across model,
  processing, batch, text, and utility modules (#1092).
- Fixed PII method quickstart docs for `mask`, `remove`, `replace`, `hash`,
  `shift_dates`, and `reidentify()` examples (#409).

### Security

- Added root `SECURITY.md`, private vulnerability disclosure guidance, security
  issue-template routing, security docs, and README links (#648).
- Added breach-notification runbook and breach report template with explicit
  no-raw-PHI/PII handling guidance (#1021).
- Added CycloneDX SBOM generation via `make sbom`, CI artifact upload, tagged
  release SBOM attachment, and supply-chain docs (#720).
- Added reproducible-lock GitHub Actions gate and contributing docs for pinned,
  hash-verified installs (#1083).
- Added lockfile drift, GitHub Actions ref, license-policy, and doctest-backed
  public-example gates (#693, #700, #763).
- Added PHI-safe defaults for progress callbacks, NDJSON error summaries,
  active-learning records, hashed examples, explain traces, dataset cards, and
  metadata scrubbing (#621, #737, #613, #765, #727, #701, #755).

### Dependencies

- Added optional extras and dependency policy entries for multimodal/OCR, spaCy,
  AWQ, GPTQ, MLX-LM, Kafka, PHILTER/pyDeid, TypeScript client support, and
  service clients (#555, #567, #624, #627, #644, #757, #759, #372, #756, #789).
- Updated GitHub Actions refs and maintenance dependencies, including checkout
  v7, setup-python v6, cache v6, upload-artifact v7, Ruff/pre-commit updates,
  and LangChain Core 1.x compatibility for the optional LangChain extra (#607,
  #710, #711, #712, #713, #714, #715).

### Removed

- No public files, modules, or APIs were removed in the reviewed release range.

### Upgrade Notes

- FHIR `OperationOutcome` output emits R4 `issue.expression`; legacy
  `issue.location` is accepted on input but is not emitted, and non-R4
  severities such as `info` are rejected (#566).
- `ServiceRuntime.get_loader()` returns the warm-pool proxy; use
  `get_model_loader()` when raw loader access is required (#632).
- Unsupported Core ML architectures now fail before model loading/tracing, and
  `--quantized-output` requires `--quantize int8` (#619).
- Custom OCR engines should tolerate the keyword-only `languages` parameter
  (#717).
- The canonical label set expanded with clinical concepts, which can affect
  callers enumerating exact label counts (#718).
- `format_preserve` expands the action enum/schema surface and updates schema
  fingerprints (#778).
- REST deployments using custom Host headers must configure
  `OPENMED_SERVICE_TRUSTED_HOSTS`; wildcard CORS/trusted-host settings are
  rejected (#686).
- OCR auto-selection order changed when optional EasyOCR or docTR engines are
  installed (#749, #558).

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- Added a policy-aware de-identification runtime with canonical `OpenMedSpan` schema contracts, a ten-stage `Pipeline`, detector arbitration/cascade routing, calibrated per-label/language/policy thresholds, deterministic safety sweep backstops, and six bundled policy profiles (`hipaa_safe_harbor`, `hipaa_expert_review_assist`, `gdpr_pseudonymization`, `research_limited_dataset`, `strict_no_leak`, `clinical_minimal_redaction`).
- Added signed, reproducible de-identification audit reports with span provenance, residual-risk metadata, reproducibility hashes, and optional HMAC signatures.
- Added re-identification risk reporting and adversarial re-identification benchmark support, including `openmed benchmark pii --attack reid`.
- Added a leakage-first evaluation harness with `BenchmarkReport`, synthetic golden de-identification fixtures, public/reference dataset adapters, DUA-gated corpus stubs, SHIELD comparison-suite support, weak labeling utilities, cold-start latency, and deterministic bootstrap confidence intervals.
- Added release-gate infrastructure for v1.6.0 model readiness: last-green baselines, calibration artifacts, G1a-G8 signed gate reports, quantization recall-delta checks, generated status/leaderboard pages, and a fail-closed release-gates workflow.
- Added clinical and interoperability utilities: ConText temporality and uncertainty axes, OHDSI Athena/Usagi ingestion, a Presidio adapter, and a deterministic FHIR R4 transaction/batch Bundle assembler.
- Added a cardiology zero-shot label-map domain (`CardiacFinding`, `ECGFinding`, `EjectionFraction`, `CardiacProcedure`, `CardiacDevice`, `Anatomy`) plus cardiology keyword routing metadata for future model registration. Public model suggestions continue to fall back to existing general medical models until a cardiology model is registered.
- Added a canonical `models.jsonl` manifest, manifest refresh workflow, manifest-driven Hugging Face model card generation, and HF publishing support for converted MLX/CoreML artifacts.
- Added a packaged `openmed` CLI surface with benchmark and calibration commands, plus a de-identification cookbook notebook and an offline clinical NER families example.
- Added governance, compliance, security, device-tier, FAQ, API reference, release-channel, status, leaderboard, and notebook documentation.

### Changed

- `deidentify()` now routes through the staged policy pipeline and accepts policy, calibration, threshold, and audit controls. When `audit=True`, it returns an audit report rather than the regular `DeidentificationResult`.
- `deidentify(..., keep_mapping=True)` now emits unique placeholders for repeated entities of the same type, such as `[NAME]` and `[NAME_2]`, so re-identification round trips can distinguish them.
- Label metadata now carries policy labels, HIPAA Safe Harbor mappings, risk levels, and ID-number subtype hints while keeping canonical labels stable.
- Benchmark steady-state latency now excludes cold start while preserving `latency.cold_start_ms` in reports.
- PyPI publishing now uses a single guarded tag/manual `publish.yml` workflow; the duplicate release workflow was removed.
- Release metadata now derives changelog sections and expected SemVer bumps from Conventional Commits.
- Python linting/formatting moved to Ruff and pre-commit, Swift formatting moved to checked-in `swift-format` scripts, and CI now enforces the updated repo policy, lint, tests, security, secret-scan, Swift-format, and release-gate jobs.
- Packaging now includes the model manifest, release-gate baseline, policy/schema JSON, `LICENSE`, and `NOTICE`.

### Fixed

- Fixed `method="shift_dates"` to recognize canonical date labels before redaction, so lowercase `date` output from the default English PII model and `date_of_birth` labels are shifted instead of masked; `keep_mapping` no longer treats shifted dates as mask placeholders.
- FHIR Bundle assembly now rejects duplicate `ResourceType/id` values instead of silently overwriting the earlier resource in the internal reference map. Duplicate resources raise a `ValueError` that names the colliding key, preventing downstream references from being rewritten to the wrong Bundle entry.
- REST/MCP request schemas now accept `ar`, `ja`, and `tr` for the `lang` field. These languages have published PII models and are listed in `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES`, but the `lang` `Literal` in `openmed/service/schemas.py` was never updated, so the service rejected them with a 422 even though the Python API and the models worked. The four `lang` annotations now share a single `PIILanguage` alias kept in sync with `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` (guarded by a regression test).
- Fixed case-insensitive `trust_remote_code` allowlist matching for first-party and environment-configured privacy-filter repositories.
- Fixed Feb 29 date shifting when `keep_year=True` targets a non-leap year.
- Fixed REST oversized-text handling with `OPENMED_SERVICE_MAX_TEXT_LENGTH` (default `1_000_000` characters).
- Fixed `BatchProcessor.iter_process` so `batch_size` is honored while preserving output order.
- Fixed duplicate benchmark fixture IDs, duplicate benchmark CLI registration, release-gate behavior when no candidate report is present, and repo-policy ignored-file handling.
- Fixed user-controlled HTML formatter escaping and validation false positives for legitimate long non-ASCII/CJK clinical text.
- Fixed reversible `remove` mappings and repeated entity-type re-identification round trips when `keep_mapping=True`.

### Security

- Added a protected `hf-publish` environment and `HF_WRITE_TOKEN` policy for model publishing.
- Added dependency license policy, `pip-audit` security gate with time-boxed ignores, and gitleaks CI/pre-commit secret scanning with a canary fixture.
- Hardened de-identification audit report signing so `AuditReport.sign()` and `AuditReport.verify()` require a non-empty HMAC key. `None`, empty strings, and empty byte strings now raise `ValueError` instead of producing or accepting weak signatures.

### Tests

- Added FHIR Bundle regression coverage for empty resource lists across transaction, collection, and batch Bundles, and for dangling references that should remain unchanged when the referenced resource is absent from the Bundle.

### Notes

- `shift_dates` remains available as a compatibility alias; prefer `method="shift_dates"` in new code.
- REST clients sending more than `OPENMED_SERVICE_MAX_TEXT_LENGTH` characters now receive a 422 response unless the limit is raised.
- Full SHIELD/DUA datasets require approved or user-supplied access paths; restricted corpus rows are not vendored.
- Release-gate candidates for v1.6.0 need release metadata, calibration evidence for masking/replacement profiles, span fixtures for G8, and quantization evidence for quantized formats.

## [1.5.5] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- Added batch PII extraction and de-identification support through `BatchProcessor(operation="extract_pii")` and `BatchProcessor(operation="deidentify")`, including document-level `batch_size` chunking, shared loader/pipeline reuse, tests, docs, and a runnable example.
- Added REST service model lifecycle controls with `GET /models/loaded`, `POST /models/unload`, request-level `keep_alive`, `OPENMED_SERVICE_KEEP_ALIVE`, and model-loader cache release helpers.
- Added chunked Swift/OpenMedKit PII extraction for long OCR text and refreshed the OpenMed Scan Demo clinical document flow with updated sample text, a printable sample PDF, and a generator script.
- Added a project mascot, brand assets in `docs/brand/`, and an animated on-device PII de-identification demo (`docs/brand/openmed-pii-demo.gif`).
- Added README translations in 13 languages with a language switcher: zh-CN, es, fr, de, it, pt, nl, ar, hi, te, ja, tr, fa.

### Changed

- Batched privacy-filter inference now accepts list inputs across Torch and MLX paths and forwards batching controls to the underlying pipelines.
- The OpenMed Scan Demo now unloads inactive MLX runtime families when switching engines, sequences selected and secondary PII engine runs explicitly, improves OCR line ordering, and expands entity category mapping.
- README and service/model-loader documentation now cover batch PII operations and model unloading behavior.
- Overhauled the README with a visual hero, brand badges, Apple Silicon/Swift/iOS entry points, an OpenMed-vs-cloud comparison table, and a Mermaid flow diagram.

### Fixed

- Improved Swift structured PII recovery for clinical discharge summaries, including surname-first names, member and insurance IDs, account/encounter/document IDs, NPI values, PCP/signed-provider sections, and overlap deduplication.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-05-27

### Security

- Hardened the privacy-filter dispatcher to refuse `trust_remote_code=True` for model identifiers outside an explicit allowlist of first-party OpenAI/OpenMed privacy-filter family models (`openai/privacy-filter`, `OpenMed/privacy-filter-multilingual`, `OpenMed/privacy-filter-nemotron`). Previously, any HuggingFace repository whose name contained the substring `privacy-filter` would be loaded with custom-code execution enabled, allowing remote code execution by anyone able to control the `model_name` parameter on `/pii/extract` or `/pii/deidentify`. Operators with custom fine-tunes of the privacy-filter family can extend the allowlist via the `OPENMED_TRUSTED_REMOTE_CODE_MODELS` environment variable (comma-separated repo IDs).
- Changed `PrivacyFilterTorchPipeline`'s `trust_remote_code` default from `True` to `False`. The first-party dispatcher (`openmed.core.backends.create_privacy_filter_pipeline`) opts in explicitly only for allowlisted models.

### Changed

- README, docs, and website version surfaces now point at `1.5.2`.

### Fixed

- Fixed raw HuggingFace-to-MLX conversion for the OpenAI Privacy Filter family (`openai/privacy-filter`, `OpenMed/privacy-filter-nemotron`, and `OpenMed/privacy-filter-multilingual`) by casting BF16 tensors to float32 before NumPy conversion, remapping OPF/Nemotron checkpoints into the OpenMed MLX runtime layout, fusing Q/K/V projections, preserving classifier bias, and validating converted weight keys/shapes before artifact save.

### Tests

- Added `tests/unit/test_privacy_filter_security.py` covering the identifier matcher, allowlist gate, env-var override, local-artifact trust, and dispatcher opt-in.
- Added HTTP-level regression tests in `tests/unit/service/test_api.py` that POST the attacker-controlled `model_name` payload to `/pii/extract` and `/pii/deidentify` and verify the privacy-filter dispatcher is never reached.
- Added MLX converter regressions for BF16 NumPy conversion, OPF weight remapping, QKV fusion order, and partial-QKV rejection.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-05-21

### Changed

- README, docs, website, and Apple demo version surfaces now point at `1.5.1`.
- Prepared the patch release metadata for the tag-driven build and publish workflow.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- Arabic (`ar`), Japanese (`ja`), and Turkish (`tr`) PII extraction support in the Python SDK, including language defaults, localized regex patterns, fake replacement data, and anonymizer locale routing.
- Registry entries for all API-visible Arabic, Japanese, and Turkish PII source checkpoints: 2 Arabic, 3 Japanese, and 32 Turkish models.
- Preconverted MLX routing for the 28 supported Arabic, Japanese, and Turkish PII `-mlx` repositories so `OpenMedConfig(backend="mlx")` can resolve uploaded artifacts directly.
- Turkish TCKN checksum validation plus context-aware Arabic and Japanese national ID patterns.

### Changed

- README, docs, website, and Apple demo version surfaces now point at `1.5.0`.
- Faker anonymization now falls back to `en_US` with a warning if a requested locale is unavailable at runtime.

### Fixed

- Turkish street-address matching now accepts both descriptor-first forms such as `Cadde İnönü 12` and common Turkish name-first forms such as `Atatürk Caddesi 12`.

### Tests

- Added language constant/default routing, model registry count, MLX mapping, anonymizer locale, and multilingual PII regression coverage for Arabic, Japanese, and Turkish.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-05-17

### Changed

- README, docs, website, and Apple demo version surfaces now point at `1.4.1`.

### Fixed

- `ModelLoader` now resolves existing filesystem paths before prepending the default Hugging Face org, so local model directories load correctly.
- Local model paths now set `local_files_only=True` across config, tokenizer, model, pipeline, and max-length probing to keep offline and air-gapped inference fully local.
- `analyze_text()` now accepts `model_id` as an alias for `model_name`, including local directory paths.

### Tests

- Added unit coverage for local path resolution, local-only loading, and `model_id` alias handling.
